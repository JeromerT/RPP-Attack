Hi,

I use Lucene to search on my documentation using a web interface.=20
After I perform a search I want to refine the result set using a new =
query. How can I do that?

Thanks.

Hi all,

we finally finished the 0.2 release of our little personal document 
management tool based on Lucene:

  http://tockit.sourceforge.net/docco/index.html

This might be interesting for some readers of this list since its source 
contains some infrastructure for document handlers and index management. 
The document handlers are written with a very simple API, which just 
asks the implementation to fill a structure with the information 
retrieved from a URL. It is similar to the Ant task in the Lucene 
sandbox, but it separates the information collection and the actual 
indexing, i.e. all the decisions what should be stored and what shouldn't.

The program comes with implementations for plain text, HTML (based on 
Swing), XML (based on JAXP) and Open Office (using ZipStreams/SAX). We 
wrote plugins for POI, PDFbox and Multivalent. The latter is 
unfortunately a wild hack since Multivalent is the worst Java code I've 
seen. Literally. Bad C written in Java. The tool would be nice to use, 
but catching exceptions in little helper classes to do a System.exit is 
just insane. And that is just one of the problems -- we had to do some 
bad hacks to fix these issues. The other implementations should be fine, 
although they need some more testing.

The source (including all required libs) of the program is available via 
Sourceforge's CVS:

  http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=37081

The module in question is called "docco". A current snapshot of only the 
source is here:

  http://tockit.sourceforge.net/docco/source20030902.zip (~100kb)


The relevant packages are:

  org.tockit.docco.documenthandler: the documenthandler interface and 
implementations
  org.tockit.docco.filefilter: some code to pick document handlers via 
file extensions or regexps
  org.tockit.docco.index: the model/static bits of the index management
  org.tockit.docco.indexer: the dynamic aspects of the index management: 
runnable, framework for handlers

The index management is probably not optimal, I strongly suspect that an 
expert could tweak it. But the structure should be ok.

We would be happy to contribute this code to the Lucene sandbox if there 
is interest. Or to turn it into a project of its own, we don't think it 
should be hidden in our more specific program. It should be easy to 
merge it with the Ant task and we are happy to give a hand if wanted. 
Adding some documentation would be easy, too -- at the moment the code 
is still more for ourself, but it should be very readable by itself. We 
require JDK 1.4, but this can be reduced by moving some more document 
handlers into plugins.

Anyone interested in joining into maintaining this code? Any feedback is 
welcome.

Cheers,
   Peter

Sorry, I don't think there is such a document.  It would be nice to
have it, though.  You could, however, gather a lot of information from
pages like the query syntax, various articles, etc.

Hi Peter.

Docco is a great tool which I have been using since you posted your first
announcement (version 1.0, that is). Beside the things you mention in you
mail I also generally think it's a great idea to using formal concept
analysis with Lucene. I would be interested to explore the idea also for
more structured data (maybe include fields and even hierarchies).

Apart from this, if I had an idea of the time commitments connected, I would
definitely consider to join.

Best,

Gregor

As far as I know it is not on the to-do list of any of the more active
Lucene developers.  In other words, it is waiting for some external
contributor with more time and with required knowledge.

Code that worked with one of the 1.2 versions was posted to the list a
looong time ago by Dmitry.

Hi all,

this is partly connected to Docco's new filters. Is there anyone interested
in a Powerpoint filter? This format seems to have been kept incredibly
obscure by out big friends in Redmond. I did only find a shareware tool
called CZ-PPT2TXT, but open source would i.m.h.o. be a bit more usable in
our community...

Cheers,

Gregor

Great.  Is there an example anywhere on how I might be able to build such a 
Query?  QueryParser isn't really all that simple since it's built with 
JavaCC.

What might be ideal for me is if I can continue to use the highlevel 
interface to build the main query (ie use it to parse my query string and 
return me some kind of Query - BooleanQuery, TermQuery, etc) and then build 
a WildcardQuery by hand and "combine" the two together?  For example, is it 
as simple as calling Query.combine() to combine the two?  Is there a better 
way?  Is there a documented example like this?  Thanks!

Not sure about documented examples, but I often find the unit tests (in =
src/test of lucene's CVS) to be very useful  for examples but I didn't =
see any for what you are looking for.

Basically, query parser builds up a vector of BooleanClause objects then =
loops over those on a BooleanQuery object calling add(BooleanClause). I =
agree JavaCC isn't really simple to follow, but there is a lot of plain =
java in there that does the parts you are interested in and if you build =
the .java file and ignore the token parsing stuff, you can look at in =
your favorite java IDE.

What you can do is cast the query you get from QueryParser to a =
BooleanQuery (that is the only type of Query that QueryParser will =
return) then create your WildcardQuery or any other queries you need =
that you didn't get in the query string and add them as clauses to the =
BooleanQuery using add(Query query, boolean required, boolean =
prohibited).

I don't know how query combine works (never used it), but the javadoc =
comment leads me to believe it is not what you are looking for and a bit =
of poking around in the sources gives me the same impression.

It seems when I do a search such as "covered wagon" ~5 or the like,
the systems disregards the order of my terms.  I.E., it will find =
covered
within 5 of wagon and it will also find wagon within 5 of covered.

Is there anyway to make the system respond only to the order of the
terms as entered in the query?

Sounds interesting. We will be busy with other things for a month or 
two, afterwards we will probably do some experiments with extending 
Docco towards LSA and similar technologies (main idea is guessing good 
keywords to refine the query -- which is a bit different if you are 
happy with overspecified queries). If you have some particular ideas we 
can discuss them on tockit-general@lists.sf.net. Combining the current 
Docco approach with conceptual scaling could be interesting -- if that 
is what you mean. It would be a bit off-topic here, so let's put this on 
our list.

The question for this list was more if someone is interested in turning 
the indexing and index managements bits into a separate project. I'd 
love to see it used by a broader audience and I think it would make 
getting started with Lucene a bit easier for some people -- at least if 
we add a little JavaDoc in form of package.htmls and class descriptions. 
And there are not that many classes, so that shouldn't be too much pain.

Hey -- it is Open Source and voluntary. You commit as much time as you 
want ;-) Not that that couldn't be a problem -- at least I tend to try 
too many things at once.

If you are interested in more Docco-specific things, just post your 
ideas on our mailing list. That's usually a good start to get involved. 
And I am academic enough to always find the time to discuss things -- 
doing them is the hard bit :-) Once I understand what exactly you want 
to do I can probably give you a reasonable estimate of the effort involved.

Cheers,
  Peter

I wanted to see this in action myself, so I coded up a small unit test:

     public void testOrderDoesntMatter() throws Exception {
         Directory directory = new RAMDirectory();
         IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(directory, new 
WhitespaceAnalyzer(), true);
         Document doc = new Document();
         doc.add(Field.Text("field", "one two"));
         writer.addDocument(doc);
         writer.optimize();
         writer.close();

         IndexSearcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(directory);
         PhraseQuery query = new PhraseQuery();
         query.setSlop(5);
         query.add(new Term("field", "two"));
         query.add(new Term("field", "one"));
         Hits hits = searcher.search(query);
         assertEquals(1, hits.length());
         searcher.close();
     }

Notice that I'm searching for "two one"~5 (yet indexed "one two") and 
it found 1 hit.

And then, like a typical programmer, I looked at the Javadocs *after* 
coding :) and found this on PhraseQuery:

   /** Sets the number of other words permitted between words in query 
phrase.
     If zero, then this is an exact phrase search.  For larger values 
this works
     like a <code>WITHIN</code> or <code>NEAR</code> operator.

     <p>The slop is in fact an edit-distance, where the units correspond 
to
     moves of terms in the query phrase out of position.  For example, 
to switch
     the order of two words requires two moves (the first move places 
the words
     atop one another), so to permit re-orderings of phrases, the slop 
must be
     at least two.

     <p>More exact matches are scored higher than sloppier matches, thus 
search
     results are sorted by exactness.

     <p>The slop is zero by default, requiring exact matches.*/
   public void setSlop(int s) { slop = s; }

So what you observe is the correct documented behavior.

> Is there anyway to make the system respond only to the order of the
> terms as entered in the query?

I'm sure there is a way to make an OrderedPhraseQuery, although I'll 
need to do some more homework myself to craft such a thing.  All the 
information to do such a thing is available, although maybe it wouldn't 
be as performant as PhraseQuery (just a guess, no facts to back that up 
yet).

Is it possible to get QueryParser.parse() to parse queries defaulting to
'AND' rather than 'OR'?

Currently if you search for 'A B' that is the same as 'A OR B'.  What I
would like is to default to 'A AND B'.

Apologies for the simple question.  I'm guessing the answer is probably more complex
(like Lucene returning A+B, then A, then B)?  I couldn't find anything in
the FAQ about this.

Cheers,
Scott

Look at QueryParser.setOperator() (perhaps it was added after your 
version?)

This is what I'm looking for.  Too easy.

Well, like Eric mentioned, if you can just ignore JavaCC syntax and look
at embedded Java code, it's not all that complicated (especially you have
done something with yacc/bison, to know how parser generators generally
work)... but granted at first looks bit alien. :-)

Now, I haven't tested this, but I would think that just building single Query 
that searches wild card phrase "some th*" in field "my_field", you'd just do:

Query q = new WildcardQuery(new Term("my_field", "some th*"));

and feed that to whichever search object you need. In this particular case you 
could also use PrefixQuery instead; if so, you need strip out the trailing 
"*" (since that's implied when constructing PrefixQuery).

Eric described the method of combining queries that should work as far as I 
could see. If you do not want to rely on QueryParer to return BooleanQuery, 
you can also just build your your BooleanQuery, and wrap sub-queries as 
BooleanClauses. That's bit more work but should work as well.

Good luck and let us know if that works,

PhraseQuery uses a SloppyPhraseScorer, and its phaseFreq method is what 
makes the order not matter.  I'm pretty sure a new OrderedPhraseQuery 
that subclassed PhraseQuery and overrode createWeight and did something 
similar to the SloppyPhraseScorer would do the trick.

I am wondering if Lucene is the way to go for my project. I don't know what
other search engines are available out there, and how Lucene stacks up
against them. I am wondering if Lucene has a full set of searching features,
comparable to what I might find in a reasonably priced commercial package.
Anyone with a solid knowledge of Lucene care to make me feel warm and fuzzy
about my decision so far to use Lucene ?

     Probably.  Tell us a little about your project.

     Lucene isn't a search engine _application_, it's a search engine
_API_.  Lucene gives you what you need in order to build the search
engine you want, instead of spending gobs of time trying to figure out
the 10,000 options available for a search engine application, or
trying to warp somebody else's ideas of what you need to meet what you
really need.

     Pretty well, if you're willing to put a (very) little time and
energy into to building the application you need.  I know.  I've done
it.

     There is no comparison :-).  Lucene is a fundamentally decent
piece of technology.  This puts it head and shoulders above most
commercial packages.

     Specifically, the Lucene search engine API is blindingly fast at
searching and at indexing, and comes with several built-in packages to
provide several of the commonly needed functions (like a web search
engine style query language parser).  

     Additionally, a wide variety of people have been down this road
and done a wide variety of things with Lucene, so you're likely to be
able to find examples, in the Lucene sandbox or in the lucene-user
archives, of how to do whatever it is you want to do.

> Anyone with a solid knowledge of Lucene care to make me feel warm

     Tell us a little more about your project requirements and I'll
tell you enough specifics to give you a warm and fuzzy feeling.
Lucene isn't perfect for _everything_ (and anybody who claims that a
given technology *is* perfect for _everything_ is lying).  But it's
quite good for a number of things.

I did a couple of basic tests using the WildcardQuery like below and it 
seemed to work.  I have not tried an example using the PrefixQuery and I 
doubt that I will.

Because of the nature of my application I'm guaranteed to have at least one 
search term but the majority of the time it will be more then one.  So in my 
particular case, I'll almost always get a BooleanQuery back from 
QueryParser.  I'm currently working on an implementation of Eric's 
suggestion.

Lucene Users List <lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org>

> > I am wondering if Lucene is the way to go for my project.

It's pretty basic. I'm just indexing 4 large text files, ranging up to 100MB
in size. They don't ever change, and are on a CD-ROM. Each file contains a
bunch of small documents. I just create one index for all 4 of them. These
documents are for an association that I belong to - they contain a history
of the association's documents - and my application allows you to search
them.

They are actually currently indexed by an application called 'Sonar', by
Virginia Systems. But I REALLY didn't like using their user interface -
blech - so I decided to
write a new interface for my own use. But Sonar costs some real bucks to be
able to develop against their search API, so I found Lucene, and decided to
go with it.

Here are the search features that 'Sonar' has :
  Boolean Searching
  Proximity Searching
  Wild Card Searching
  Field/Block Searching
  Relevancy Ranking / Date Ranking
  List of Occurrences in Context

  Phonetic Searching
  Synonyms/Concepts
  Relational Searching
  Associated Words
  Drill Down Search Narrowing

I think that Lucene has all the features in the first group. How does it
stack up against the second group ?

I'm writing the whole thing in Swing, which has been time consuming, and so
have invested quite a bit of time into this project. But I'm seeing the end
of the tunnel, and want to make sure that I'm going down the right path
before I spend too much more time on it.

This problem can be solved by using multiple indexes...  One problem is 
that a result set can only return 2^32 documents though but this is 
totally acceptable for me.

I wonder what the JVM implementation is like for Itanium... Can this 
allocate transactional 64bit longs?

If to it might make sense to distribute a lucene-long.jar with all the 
document handles being longs instead of ints.  If I'm correct it is just 
a recompile...

     Well, aside from your concerns about the second list, Lucene
seems perfect for your needs.  You'd parse apart the four big files
into a bunch of small documents, the parse those small documents and
create lucene Documents, containing Fields, and add them to the index.

     I'm not sure what Field/Block means.  Boolean, Proximity and
WildCard, are pretty typical in Lucene searches.  You should probably
take a look at the Query Parser syntax docs:

     http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/queryparsersyntax.html


>   Relevancy Ranking / Date Ranking

     Lucene search results are typically ranked by relevance, and you
can tweak the search to adjust this (there's a fair bit of discussion
of this in the lucene-user archives, a good keyword to look for is
"slop" and "boost").

     Sorting output by date might take some finesse.  I haven't played
with sorting by date, but I'd expect to handle that by directly
instantiating a QueryTerm to indicate the date issues.

>   List of Occurrences in Context

     I assume here that you mean displaying the results with a little
snapshot of the text around it.  There have been discussions about how
best to do this (often focused around highlighting the search terms in
the displayed text) on the lucene-users list.  Check the list archive.
 
>   Phonetic Searching

     I'd guess you need to build this one yourself, perhaps by using a
soundex algorithm when indexing the original data files.

>   Synonyms/Concepts

     Likewise... you'd need to come up with some sort of ontology of
synonyms and concepts, then parse the fields you're indexing and
generate a synonym/concept field that you'd add to the lucene
Document.

     I'm not sure what these three mean.

     I'm afraid I haven't been too helpful here.  Perhaps if you
clarify what the above mean, folks can post about how to implement it
in Lucene.

     It sounds like you ought to at least seriously consider using
Lucene, if you can find or implement equivalent features, or decide
you can live without them.

Hello,

Has anyone written an application that uses Lucene to index Java code,
either from the source .java files, or compiled .class files?

I need to create a searchable index for Java code, so that I can use
that index to check if classes or methods with certain functionality
have already been written.  This is an effort to remove code
duplication and do more code re-use.  If this application can also
index Javadocs, even better!

I think I heard of somebody doing this already.  Kevin Burton?
This is something that would fit nicely in Erik's Ant IndexTask in
Lucene Sandbox), I think.

Thank you,
Otis

If you are talking about my ultra secret project "Zapata: Coding 
Mexican Style", then yes ;)

But... it uses runtime information to reach its devious ends and is 
more like a documentation tool than anything else...

Anyway, this is how it goes:

Given a set of binary jar files it builds an object graph of the 
bytecode: packages, classes, methods and so on. Complete with 
interdependencies and other handy informations. The bytecode is also 
run through a decompiler and pretty printed to normalize the source. 
Code segments are attached and indexed alongside their owners (class or 
method). All this fully indexed, searchable and cross referenced.

This is built upon the same engine used by ZOE, so the end result is 
very much along the lines of what ZOE does for email, but for code 
instead... fun, fun, fun ;)

Cheers,

PA.

What you describe sounds interesting, but I was thinking more along the
lines of this:

http://www.peerfear.org/rss/permalink/2003/07/23/LuceneForSourceManagement/

An application that I could use to find out whether I already have a
'getStudents' or 'getStudents*' method somewhere in the source code,
for instance, before I start writing it.  As the code base grows
larger, and as the team that works with it becomes bigger, this tools
becomes more and more valuable.
If this application could also index Javadocs, so that I can search for
methods or classes that mention +student* +(database OR db) +update,
that would be even better.

Has anyone done this?
Kevin Burton mentioned something similar to what I described above, at
that URL, but it looks like he didn't make his application available.

Thanks,
Otis

A couple of thoughts on this:

- Eclipse uses Lucene for its code indexing/searching (I learned this 
at the OSCON Keynote by Eclipse folks).  Perhaps looking at how Eclipse 
does its thing would be useful even if not the solution.

- XDoclet could be used to sweep through Java code and build a text/XML 
file as richly as you'd like from the information there (complete with 
JavaDoc tags, which Zapata will miss :)), and then run Lucene on the 
generated files.  On a related note, the XDoclet2 architecture would 
streamline this even further by eliminating the middle textual 
representation (QDox/XJavadoc reads Java as a "meta data provider" and 
then a Lucene "plugin" indexes things).  It could be done without the 
intermediate text representation even in XDoclet 1.2, but it would 
require coding a custom subtask and be slightly out of the norm for 
XDoclet subtasks (but would work just fine).

- My <index> task could be used, but it would be better to use 
something that built a complete object-graph of all the source code you 
want indexed, so that it can deal with base classes, inherited javadoc 
tags, and other such interactions between classes you might want to 
capture.

Hi Erik,

Correct. This happen to be on purpose :) Does XDoclet build an 
"intertwingled" object graph of your code along the way? Performing a 
plain search on a code base is pretty trivial... what seems to be more 
interesting would be to put that in context.

Zapata does something along the line of what MagicHat does for 
Objective-C:

http://homepage.mac.com/petite_abeille/MagicHat/

But from the sound of what Otis is saying this is not what you guys are 
looking for... back to the pampa then...

Cheers,

PA.

hy ,
when i use standardTokenizer
for parse for example "I.B.M"
the type of the Token  is HOST and not ACRONYM

WHY ???

in StandardTokenizer.jj

 // acronyms: U.S.A., I.B.M., etc.
  // use a post-filter to remove dots
| <ACRONYM: <ALPHA> "." (<ALPHA> ".")+ >

  // hostname
| <HOST: <ALPHANUM> ("." <ALPHANUM>)+ >

"I.B.M" can be a host or acronym, so threre is a problem , no  ?

Yes, XDoclet builds a complete object graph of all the source files you 
hand it (as an Ant <fileset>).  It actually even does binary class 
interpretation for the information it needs to construct a full 
object-graph if some dependencies are in the classpath of the taskdef 
as well.

Perhaps as far as this parser goes... but... in practice... '.M' is not 
a valid TLD.

Hi,

I have a requirement whereupon I'd like to pull search results back and 
split them up based on some keyword field. So for example, says there's 
a field named 'category',  I'd like to be able to have the results 
displayed as such:

Search Results for Category A:
1,
2,
3,

Search Results for Category B:
1,
2,
3.

The two ways I can think to do this are:
1) A post-process of the results collecting the first x amount of hits 
for each category.
2) Running a different search per category.

This is probably a long shot, but I was wondering if the search itself 
has the means to filter out documents based on a limit of occurances of 
a value for a given search field.  So for example if there are 5 
categories, and we only want to show 5 results per category, then the 
maximum amount of hits returned would be 25. This is because the value 
'Category A' for the field 'category' can only appear 5 times and so 
forth.  Can anyone think of a way to achieve this?

Thanks.

Hi,

According to the QueryParser page:

"The NOT operator cannot be used with just one term".

Is this also true for multi-term NOT queries? E.g.

NOT "jakarta apache" AND NOT "lucene"

My tests suggest so, but I'd like to hear from someone
who'd know for sure.

Also, is this a limitation of the QueryParser or of
the Query API itself?

Thanks!

Eugene.

Yes... I was thinking about making an ant task for it or using someone 
else's.  One of the cool things would be direct integration within the IDE.

Also parsing the .java file into a token stream and then indexing the 
tokens would make a blazingly fast doc completion facility....

It's just two source files + Lucene plus I didn't do all the work to 
make it into an OSS package.  99% of OSS work isn't technical but 
political, maintenance, etc..

If someone wants to start an OSS project for this and do all the grunt 
work I will do the coding :)  I don't know what parser I wnat to use to 
tokenize the source but a Doclet would be perfect for this....  The only 
problem is that this wouldn't allow full differential builds and would 
slow down the generation....

Also it just dawned on me that the Emacs compile-internal function 
parses stdout in the form of file:line# so this would make a great way 
to integrate for us Emacs geeks.

It would be faster to write a native doclet as this would remove the XML 
parse overhead...  The whole point of this thing is that it needs to be 
fast!

What's the performance of IndexWriter.addDirectory?

I assume it isn't linear but is a function of the added index.  Does the 
side of the target index matter?  What about number of documents?

Do you mean the Ant build file parsing?  That would be the only XML 
parsing in the equation I'm proposing, unless you did it the clunkiest 
XDoclet 1.2 way of having an intermediate XML file.

As for speed.... QDox, I've heard, is the fastest option.  javadoc is 
the slowest parsing of the three I know of (javadoc, xjavadoc, qdox).

Hi,


I have n terms in my query and I want each term to
match content from a field, but not necessarily within
a field.

Example fields: manufacturer, description
.Now I want to search for the terms "red" "ford" in
any of these fields, but each term should match some
field.


Solutions I came up with but are really not
satisfactory:
- permute query 
  (+manufacturer:red  +description:ford) or
(+manufacturer:ford +description:red)
  rejected because the number of combinations grows
very large with many fields and many search terms
- concatenating the contents of these selected fields
into one field doing "+concat_field:ford
+concat_field:red".
  This works but now I loose all the advantages of a
multifield index.

Hopefully one of you can help me out or point me to
lucene api sections which I can extend to achieve this
 effect.

Hi,

Is there a way to speed up fuzzy queries.
I am measuring 1.5 seconds for a single fuzzy query
term
 vs all other types of queries (partial, literal,and
or) which take from 20-40 milliseconds.

I am using an index the size of 40MB querying 60.000
documents and one field containg some 200 words per
document. 

I already tried using a RAMdirectory.
Any comments, please...

You could build a query containing the Terms of the old Query and 
combine them with refiening Terms to a new Query. Using a BooleanQuery 
should be enough for this.

You don't really lose any multifield advantages - keep the other fields 
*and* the concatenated one.

I replied to your previous message, but maybe it got lost in my e-mail 
address shuffling....

Have a look at QueryFilter.  It will allow you to do search refining as 
you desire.

Only at run-time we know which fields to search
through. 
(The static index contains some 80 fields, of which on

average 5 fields are searched for, but this set can 
differ per day)

This means updating the concatenated field
when the set of searchable fields changes (daily)?
Is there a way to do this efficiently with a lucene
index, building a field based on the contents of other
fields?

Otherwise I will just make the concatenated field when

I build the index (making the index less static, coz
then it will be updated daily) and
people will have to live with that...

Hi,

I've come across the limit on the number of
required/prohibited clauses in a boolean query (the
limit  is 32). What is the reasoning for having such
limit? Can it be circumvented?

Thanks!

Eugene.

Hi Eugene,

Yes.  Doug (Cutting) added this to eliminate OutOfMemory errors that 
apparently some people were having.  Unfortunately, it causes 
backward-compatibility issues if you were used to using version 1.2.  
So, you'll need to add a call like this:

BooleanQuery.setMaxClauseCount(Integer.MAX_VALUE);

(Of course, you can set the parameter to whatever you want, but 
unrestricted works best for me.)

Hi Scott/Eugene,

I don't think that the limitation of 32 required/prohibited clauses is
related to the BooleanQuery maxClauseCount.

The default maxClauseCount of Boolean query is set to 1024.  This
restriction is to prevent a wildcard term expansion from creating a query
with thousands of clauses.  The limitation of 32 required/prohibited
clauses is a different limitation and I believe has more to do with the way
queries are processed at a low level.

Eugene, can you group your terms so that you have less than 32
required/prohibited clauses?  For example, instead of a query that is "-red
-blue -yellow -green", you could do "-(red blue yellow green)" and reduce
your required/prohibited clause count from 4 to 1.

I'm not sure what all of the 'advanced features' were also.

Phonetic Searching - probably not important to this application.

Synonym searching might be desirable, but now that I'm thinking about it,
also likely not important.

Associated Words - sounds very interesting, like 'gold' might return 'metal'
also, etc.

But Drill Down searching is very desirable. It's where you're able to search
within the results of a previous search. I'm assuming that I'll have to
implement that myself, by keeping a copy of the previous Hits list, and only
returning results that are in both lists.

Thanks very much for your reply.

How is that different from Synonym searching?

And for the second time today.... QueryFilter.  It allows narrowing the 
documents queried to only the documents from a previous Query.

Phonetic searching may be achieved by writing your own Analyzer, which 
instead (or more probably, along with) the plain tokens provides their 
phonetic codes, e.g. Double Metaphone for English, or the less useful 
but more familiar Soundex. Phonetic searching increases recall but 
lowers precision, especially if you use stemmer before phonetic encoding...

One trick to consider if using phonetic encoding is to keep around the 
histogram of the original words that have been mapped to corresponding 
phonetic codes. Then, if a query fails to provide satisfactory results, 
you can provide a useful suggestion based on the most frequent term 
found in the histogram, with equal phonetic code to the term in the query.

If you plan on using just English text, you may want to check the 
excellent (and free) WordNet database, which offers also API - both for 
query expansion and for finding "associated words" (synsets?), or 
hypernyms like in your example.

Hi,

I have been experimenting with Lucene for a few hours, and now I'm looking 
for a solution to this:

When using the SimpleAnalyzer for indexing text, data like www.hotmail.com 
seem to be indexed as www, hotmail and com which mean that a search for 
"hotmail" will return a record. This is the behavior I am looking for! 
However, since SimpleAnalyzer do not index numbers by default, I would like 
to use the StandardAnalyzer. But, Standardanalyzer do not split the input 
stream at ".".

Ideally I should propably make my own analyser, but that seems to be a bit 
complicated to me :(. Which is the simplest possible modification that I 
need to make to the Lucene source to make the StandardAnalyzer split, for 
example web-addresses, at "." into separately indexed words?

Can this be made by modifications to the StandardTokenizer.jj? How? What is 
the easiest way of getting such modification into the "compiled" Lucene? Is 
there a need for recompiling everything?

Appreciate all help!

regards
clas

I guess, it would not be an ideal solution - the first query does two 
things a) it selects a subset from the corpus; b) it assigns a relevance 
to each document of this subset. Your solution omits the second point. 
It implies, the solution will not return "good hit lists", because you 
will not consider the information value of the first query which was 
given to you by a user.

For instance, "neologism" > "George Bush" (1st>2nd query) would return 
different order of hits than "George Bush" > "neologism". Other 
examples, "Prague Berlin" > "flight" (I must go there, and I prefer an 
airplane) versus "flight" > "Prague Berlin" (I must fly, and I prefer 
Berlin).

Thus I think, Chris would implement something more complex than 
QueryFilter. If not, the results will be poorer than with the commercial 
packages he may get. He could use a different model where "AND" is not 
an associative operator (i.e. some modification of the extended Boolean 
model). It implies, he would implement it in Similarity.java (if I 
remember that class name correctly).

You can stack up the two analyzers, first run the simple then the standard
on the poutput.

Hi again,

incze I am not sure I follow you. Do you mean that I should index with the 
SimpleAnalyzer and searching with the StandardAnalyzer? That is not an 
option for me since SimpleAnalyzer do not index number/digits the way I 
would like to (however, the StandardAnalyzer does!)


I found that modifying the StandardTokenizer.jj would be possible in order 
to modify the StandardAnalyzer to my prefered behaviour. When finished 
modifying the .jj-file, I run it trough JavaCC to get the .java-files. 
However those .java-files are not possible to compile together with the 
current distribution because of problems with the exception handling (see  
http://www.mail-archive.com/lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org/msg01403.html )

Next try was to compile Lucene (nightly snapshot) from scratch using Ant. 
That failed with errors with the "class collosions":

    [javac] Compiling 128 source files to 
/home/clryd/lucene/jakarta-lucene/bin/classes
    [javac] 
/home/clryd/lucene/jakarta-lucene/bin/src/org/apache/lucene/analysis/standard/StandardTokenizer.java:14: 
duplicate class: org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardTokenizer
    [javac] public class StandardTokenizer extends 
org.apache.lucene.analysis.Tokenizer implements StandardTokenizerConstants {
    [javac]        ^
    [javac] 
/home/clryd/lucene/jakarta-lucene/bin/src/org/apache/lucene/analysis/standard/StandardTokenizerTokenManager.java:5: 
duplicate class: 
org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardTokenizerTokenManager
    [javac] public class StandardTokenizerTokenManager implements 
StandardTokenizerConstants
    [javac]        ^

So now my question is, where do I find a Lucene-verion which is possible to 
compile? Where do I find the source CVS f�r Lucene 1.2 r3, or something 
similar?

cheers
/Clas

Sorry, I found the Lucene-1.3-rc1-src files, which compiles perfectly well 
;-) and I "resolved" the original problem by including "." as a whitespace 
character in the queryParser.jj-file. This is maybe not the best solution, 
but it solved my problems for now.

Thanks

Yes, you're right.  Getting the scores of a second query based on the 
scores of the first query is probably not trivial, but probably 
possible with Lucene.  And that combined with a QueryFilter would do 
the trick I suspect.  Somehow the scores of the first query could be 
remembered and used as a boost (or other type of factor) the scores of 
the second query.

Am I off base here?

Right... but you'd still need the filtering capability as well, I would 
think - at least for performance reasons.

Well, I do not want to be a pessimist, but the boost vector is not a 
good solution due to CWI statistics. On the other hand, it is much 
better than the simple QueryFilter which, in fact, works as 0/1 boost.

Example: I use this notation: inverted_list_term:{list of W values, "-" 
denotes W=0, for 12 documents in a collection}
A:{23[16]------27}
B:{--[38]--------}
C:{18[2-]45239812}
If your first query is B, the subset of documents (denoted by brackets - 
namely, the 3rd and 4th doc) is selected, and if your second query is "A 
C", then you cannot use global IDFs, because in the subset, the IDF 
factors are different. Globally, A is better distriminator, but in the 
subset, C is better. This fact is then reflected by the hit list you 
generate, and I guess, the quality will be also affected by this.

The example shows, that you would rather export the subset to an 
auxiliary index (RAMDirectory?) and then use this structure instead of 
the original index. Obviously, it will solve the issue of speed you 
mentioned.

Unfortunately, I am not sure, if you can export the inverted lists when 
you read them. In egothor, I would use a listener in Rider class, in 
Lucene, I would have to rewrite some classes and it could be a real 
problem. Maybe, there is a solution I do not see...

Your turn ;-)

Leo

Hi all, this is my first post, so I hope not to bore you too much with my
questions:

Ok, let's say that I would like to translate system's specific URLs (i.e.
D:\Tomcat\webapps\foo\foo\bar.jsp and so on...) into  web-context specific
URLs (i.e. http://myServer/foo/foo/bar.jsp). Well, if I immagine to replace
D:\Tomcat\webapps with http://myServer things seem quite easy. My first
question is: is this the right way? As I am very new to Lucene, is there a
possibility to instruct the IndexWriter to replace system path with web path
(specified as argument) during index creation?

Secondly, this is for Struts users, a jsp page not necessarily can be
executed without passing from a Struts Action (i.e. an Action prepared some
data to display, and if we try to access the jsp directly we could have some
bad 5 minutes), so my question is: did anyone encountered this kind of
questions? Did you find any solution? For this second subject, I could think
to a sort of mapping file between JSPs and relevant actions, so that we can
assume that if the user clicks on a JSP link, instead the relevant action
for that JSP will be executed and then the JSP displayed. The mainteinance
for this solution seems CRAP.

Hope someone of you will help,

Marco

Marco,

You may want to explain what you are trying to do before you start
describing your problems.

For example, I have no idea how / why you would use Lucene to do either
of the things you are talking about below.

Cheers,
Scott

Hello,

are these links working? I tried all the mirrors.

  Is there any other place on this website, where I can get the

 	Kindly help me out.I am itching to provide 'Search facility' on 
my website and explore Lucene :-)

Thanks & Regards,

Sorry Scott, I was under the flies of enthusiasm :)  I'm trying to realize a
simple web-site search functionality and I would like to use Lucene as
index-search engine.

BTW, does it exist any book on Lucene?

Hi,

when querying with a wildcard, e.g., "project*", QueryParser (v1.3rc2-dev)
does seem to count the * as "at least one character" (RE=/.+/), i.e., the
query finds documents containing "projection" and "projective" (no stemming
involved) but not "project". Has anyone an explanation?

Not sure if I have stepped across a bug or for some reason misconfigured
Lucene. (The implementation uses MultiFieldQueryParser.)

Thanks for comments,

Gregor

Hi,

I don't know of any books on just Lucene, but I wrote a chapter on Lucene in
Professional Struts Applications. Since you're apparently using Struts, you
might find it useful.  Another book that has a chapter on Lucene is
Professional JSP.

One thing you should know about Lucene - it's not a ready-to-run search
engine.  You can't just drop it into a web application and let it go, you
have to write the code to add the content to Lucene yourself, and write the
web pages to search the Lucene index and display the results.

Thanks,
Jeff

I am able to make text searches, but am unable to search for numbers. I did
check my Analyzer class if numbers were included in the STOP-WORDS, but they
weren't.
 
Has anyone had this problem? Or does anyone have any suggestions? Any help
would be immensely appreciated.

Which Analyzer are you using?

Look at the "Analysis" section of my article here:

	http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2003/07/30/LuceneIntro.html

It will help you construct a simple test to see what your Analyzer is 
or is not doing.

Hi Jeff, DAMN!, two of the books I haven't got :) I bought Jakarta Struts
from O'reilly and another one on JSP/Servlets/Web programming.

I already wrote the user interfaces and the classes (I wrote a stateless EJB
which performs both the indexing and the researching of the result) to run
the search.

My problem is another: as you'll certainly know, as I'm running on Windows,
my Tomcat home path is something similar to:

D:\Tomcat\

Hi all,

I use StandardAnalyzer to index and to search.

If I make a query like "comp.lang.javascript", it return no hit but if I =
make this query "comp.lang.javascript*", it return the goods hits I want =
to have.

Anybody know how I could return the hits without having the * ?

Maybe changing the analyser?

Thanks in advance

Yes, change your Analyzer and use one of the other ones that does not
use a Tokenizer that splits input on non-character characters.
Or you can write your own Analyzer (example in the jGuru FAQ).

Hi,

I have a single IndexSearcher pointing at an index.  Multiple threads
are calling the search method.  Is this safe to do?  I presume it is the
right way to do it instead of creating a new IndexSearcher per thread.

But I'm having the dreaded "Too many open files" exception.  I'm running
on Windows XP (of course, otherwise it would work!).  Any ideas on how
to fix this (other than upgrading to Linux)?  Is having one
IndexSearcher the right thing to do?  No other processes are accessing
this index so I'm surprised that I'm getting this error.

Here's the exception:

Why don't you set the path field to be relative to whatever the base 
directory is that the administrator puts in?  So, you write the path 
field yourself, and just put in the relative link, like /index.jsp, 
/welcome.jsp, or whatever?  You can just use the relative link directly 
in your web application.

The book chapter covers pulling content out of a database through a data 
access layer, so it's a little different than pulling files out of a 
file system, but most of the basics are the same.

If the actual content is hidden behind wrapper JSP pages, Struts 
Actions, parameters, or whatever, the display code that writes the links 
out in the JSP page can reference a mapping like you said.  The hard 
part would be writing the mapping code, calling it should be easy.

Hope this helps,
Jeff

Jeff, that exactly what I'm realizing.

First of all I have been able to read the configuration file (by keeping an
instance of ModuleConfig at startup) and therefore to realize a mapping
between (action -> JSP). This has been only possible because even for simple
forwards I used the Struts ForwardAction. I also found the way to isolate:
protocol + server | web-app-context | action/jsp | Servlet mapping (.do /
/action/).

In the meantime, I created a stateless session bean which has a method
which, given an environment variable as a String, returns the path to that
environment variable; therefore it will be quite simple to replace, let's
say, CATALINA_HOME with the information I isolated as mentioned above.

I'm going to create an entity bean (therefore a db table) with the isolated
information (i.e. protocol, context, and so on);
when user will run a search, and possibly Lucene will return to me the list
of system-relative JSPs, I'll substitute the system-path with the web-path,
by concatenating all the web-relative information stored in the database,
and instead of presenting to the user the list of links to JSPs, I'll show
him the list of links to actions.

There is still a major problem to solve; realize somehow the mapping between
actual content-matching JSPs and JSPs which define only Tiles 'define'
statements. The reason is that the JSPs mapped vs an action in the struts
configuration file are basically empty.

I'll have to work around it.

Yes, you can use a single IndexSearcher with multiple threads.  I have
done so in servlet environments.
This is a common question, so I suggest you check the archives.
Make sure your index is optimized.

Hi,

with a bunch of machines with 2GB of RAM but somehow limited IO bandwidth,
due to indexing on a NFS I wonder how I can optimize indexing. Part of the
problem may be that I want to index individual sentences. I have in the
order of
120e6 sentences to index. Looking at the indexing process with 'top' I see
that it
is consuming only 20% of CPU time and is in state 'D'elayed most of the
time,
most probably waiting on IO.

Any ideas how I can tweak the indexing to use more RAM and less IO? I toyed
with IndexWriter.mergeFactor, but have no idea whether to set it to 100 or
100000.

  Thanks,
  Harald.

I included some information about improving indexing performance in my
second Lucene article on Onjava.com.  The article was published a few
months ago, so you'll have to enter Lucene in the search box on
Onjava.com site.

  Hi all,

  I have ported the kstem stemmer to Java and incorporated it to Lucene. =
You can get the source code (Kstem.jar) from the following website:

http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/downloads/

  Just click on "KStem Java Implementation" (you will need to register =
your e-mail, for free of course, with the CIIR --Center for Intelligent =
Information Retrieval, UMass -- and get an access code).


Content of Kstem.jar:

java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemData1.java
java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemData2.java
java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemData3.java
java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemData4.java

java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemData8.java
java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemFilter.java
java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/KStemmer.java

KStemData1.java, ..., KStemData8.java   Contain several lists of words =
used by Kstem
KStemmer.java      Implements the Kstem algorithm=20
KStemFilter.java     Extends TokenFilter applying Kstem


To compile

unjar the file Kstem.jar to Lucene's "src" directory, and compile it =

Hi all,

	I have a field called "echelon" that are assigned to certain files.  Is
there a query I can write that will give me all files that have this field?

	I have tried stuff like echelon:.+*, echelon:*, etc... some give a query
parser exception while others return nothing.

Let me know,

Rob

Yes, you can use a single IndexSearcher with multiple threads.  I have
done so in servlet environments. This is a common question, so I suggest
you check the archives. Make sure your index is optimized.

Hi,

I tried today to download Lucene 1.3 but the link
http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-lucene/release/v1.3-rc1
seems to be broken and is redirected to
http://jakarta.apache.org/site/binindex.cgi.

Scroll down, to a bit more after the middle of that page
(binindex.cgi).  Lucene 1.2 is there.  Lucene 1.3 has not been released
yet, but we are hoping to do it soon.

That you need to get directly out of CVS.  How that is done is
described on the Jakarta site (sorry, don't have the link).

Many thanks, this was helpful. I wonder if you could just
put a paragraph in the javadocs about mergeFactor saying that 

  "it is the number of documents kept
   in memory before writing them to file. To minimize file system
   access, raise this number, but expect up to
   (mergeFactor+1)*numFilesPerSegment files to be open
   at the same time, which may be beyond the processes limit".

This would explain a lot.

  Thanks,
  Harald.

I have done negative boosts, it does work; you must construct your
query terms accordingly. I found the results somewhat unintuitive -
the mixture of negative and postive boosts (mainly 1.0), TF/IDF=20
and document length normalization will very often make documents=20
more relevant that you did not expect to be.=20

Karsten

Otis,

	Are you referring to this:

		How do I retrieve all the values of a particular field that exists within
an index, across all documents?

I need a query to do it, the only way clients access the index is via
queries so they cannot write the code in the faq above.

Thanks,

Rob

Go to Lucene FAQ at jGuru.com and search for the word 'all'.

Aha.  You can't do it with a query, unless you add a fixed-value field
to all documents added to your index.
e.g.
field:X

Then you can get all documents by searching for +field:X

I think there's always room for better documentation.  If you have ideas

Why not just AND together the first and second query?  That way they're 
both incorporated in the ranking.  Filters are good when you don't want 
it to affect the ranking, and also when the first query is a criterion 
that you'll reuse for many queries (e.g., language=french), since the 
bit vectors can be cached (as by QueryFilter).

I have some extensions to Lucene that I've not yet commited which make 
it possible to easily define synthetic IndexReaders (not currently 
supported).  So you could do things that way, once I check these in. 
But is this really better than just ANDing the clauses together?  It 
would take some big experiments to know, but my guess is that it doesn't 
make much difference to compute a "local" IDF for such things.

You probably missed the start of our discussion - we are talking about 
this: "q1 -> q2" which means "NOT q1 OR q2", versus "q2 -> q1" which 
means "q1 OR NOT q2". It causes the issue, and it also shows why you 
cannot use the simple "AND", because "q1 AND q2" != "NOT q1 OR q2" != 
"q1 OR NOT q2".

BTW: I didn't see the logic formulas for many years, so it is without 
any guarantee ;-)

In this case, I think that the operator would be evaluated as "an 
implication" and not "AND" (=1-(((1-q1)^p+(1-q2)^p )/2 )^(1/p)). 
Obviously, you have to use an filter to filter out false hits (in case 
of q1->q2, the formula is true when q1 is false, so it is not what you 
really need), but it is not an issue with the auxiliary index. On the 
other hand, it is a feeling and it needs a test, you are right.

You could put the text for category A documents in one field, and the 
text for category B documents in another field, then run two searches, 
one of each field.  Then, if you need to search both categories with 
merged results, construct a query that searches both fields.  If you 
never need to do that, you could even use two separate indexes.

Hi all...

I'm getting a BooleanQuery$TooManyClauses exception and I'm not really 
sure why.  I only get it when I do a wild card search, and even then, 
not all the time.

Searching for "ca*" and "pa3*" works just fine, but "pa*" or "pa1*" 
fails with:

org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery$TooManyClauses
	at org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery.add(BooleanQuery.java:109)
	at org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery.add(BooleanQuery.java:101)

	at org.apache.lucene.search.Searcher.search(Searcher.java:71)
	at org.apache.lucene.search.Searcher.search(Searcher.java:65)


Does anyone have any idea what might be causing this?  I'm using the 
QueryParser to build my query for me and the SnowballAnalyzer and and 
IndexSearcher with to perform the search.  This is with what's currently 
in CVS.


Thanks,
-Mark

So I've done some digging, and it looks like I can resolve this problem 
by setting the max clause count on BooleanQuery.  However, I'm not 
really sure what this affects.

Can anyone describe what this property controls?  Surely it was set to 
1024 for a reason...

Thanks,
-Mark

Are the endOffset, startOffset fields of a Token used in 
proximity search and phrase search.

My problem is that I tried my own TokenStream and may have
messed up the offsets. What are the restrictions for a phrase
search to work? Do the offsets of tokens have to be exactly
adjacent?

My own TokenStream drops all numbers. The document IDs I store with a
document 
are numbers. I enter the ID field as a keyword field. Consquently it is not
run through
tokenization and ends up nicely in the index.

However, when I want to query according to the ID field, the query is run
through
the tokenizer. The tokenizer drops the number producing no output and
the query produces no result.

DISCUSSION:
The immediate solution is to instruct my Analyzer to generate a different
TokenStream
for the ID field, namely one which does not drop numbers.

However, the Lucene documents, tutorials and FAQ state often enought that
document tokenization and query tokenization must be identical to get
consistent results. Therefore I would expect that the information whether
a field needs tokenization or not is taken from the index when querying.
This,
however, is not possible because it seems a field name does not need
consistently
refer to a tokenized or non-tokenized field.

I wonder if it would make sense to requrie that fields names are registered
with the index before they can be used in Documents and to then
enforce consistent use.

I have a web application developed with Struts and I wish to add the ability
for users to search the web application content.

Some of the web application pages are directly accessible via a URL and
others are only accessible via a Struts action mapping URL.

All of the web application pages are composite pages (similar to Tiles)
where
each page includes and populates a template with content. The content may
come from various locations but the runtime result is a complete page.

After downloading Lucene and working with the demo applications I quickly
realized the problems voiced by Marco Tedone  in this archived message:

http://www.mail-archive.com/lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org/msg04656.html


I read through the thread and it didn't appear that there was a
simple/elegant solution.

I was wondering if anyone has come up with a simple/elegant solution for
using Lucene
with Struts/Tiles.

You could crawl the web site to build the index.  The crawling strategy is
going to vary depending on how your site is set up in terms of secured areas
vs non-secured, how pages are linked, etc.

Well, I'm working on it and I collected all the information I need. Now it's
time to put them together in a unique, possibly fully functional solution.

What I'm realizing is a search facility which shows the user links to
actions which forward to the jsp of interest. This is possible by retrieving
the configuration information both on the struts-config.xml file (mapping
between action and JSPs), and on the tiles-defs.xml file (Yes, I'm using
Tiles). I've been desperate for a while, but then someone from the struts
mailing list illuminated me with the following trick:

 <definition name="tiles.administer" extends="xmlLayout">
      <put name="title" value="Jemos Administation page"/>
      <put name="security" value="/shared/adminSecurityTest.jsp"/>
      <put name="body" value="/site/bodies/administer-body.jsp"/>
      <put name="definition.location.tiles.administer"
value="administer.jsp" />

Basically, it seems (because I haven't tried yet) that it's possible to
define an additional property in a Tiles definition, without it being
actually present in any JSP. If we immagine to put a property which tells,
for each JSP which really contains the content, which is the JSP defined in
the struts configuration file, from there it's possible to get the map
between an action and this JSP, therefore (even if the road is quite long)
the mapping is possible. Here's how it works:

1) An administrator function (in my case a Struts action) creates an index,
given a specific folder (in my case the webapp/myapp folder) as input, a
desired folder as output, and specifying one or more file extensions to
consider for the search (Search facility realized with a steteless session
bean deployed under Jboss). The result is a database with the following
fields:

2) A user submits a query: a component will retrieve from the index all the
content-matching JSPs paths and thanks to another facility I developed, it
will remove the system-relative-path (let's say D:\Tomcat\webapps because
I'm running on Windows) from the JSP (returning the context relative path,
let's say myapp/content-body.jsp). All the matching JSPs will be returned as
a collection (or something similar...).

3) For each path, another component will look in the Tiles defs the matching
JSP (thanks to the above trick!); with this information the Struts
configuration file will be queried and the matching action retrieved: from
here it's quite simple to create a web-fully-context-path to show to the
user...

Result? The user will be shown with links to the actions which map to the
JSPs which contain what she searched for...

Limit? Initially this application will work for Tiles (even if I'll try to
apply some design patterns to allow different implementation) but my goal is
to design a general solution which could work with basic JSPs, include JSPs
and so on...

Hope this will help,

Marco

Are you running on Windows?  Make sure you only have one IndexWriter or
IndexReader open at a time.  When I had both open I would get this
message.  Also, increase the mergefactor to 100 or so.

Yes! I came to the same conclusion. It seems like the most elegant solution
for web applications built using composite pages (Struts or non-struts).

Has anyone implemented this approach?

Has anyone used LARM for this type of approach?

Marco thanks for replying....but alas I'm not using
Tiles with this project.

Hi,
I am using Lucene 1.3 rc released on March.20, 2003.
For some reason, the files in the index directory increase very very quickly
for some documents and reach over 3000 files within half hour and even can
not optimize the index.Then it grows up to 33000 files within one index.
In most of other testing cases, it normally never reach 1000 even without
optimization.

Any idea about this?

regards,
Hui

No.  There are not used by indexing or search.  Their intent is only to 
aid the extraction of matching text snippets when displaying results.

I've been lurking on these related threads to see what others came up  
with.

The real issue here is defining what the "content" really is.  If the  
web application is solely your own creation, then I feel crawling or  
weird magical tricks with Struts/Tiles/taglibs is not the proper  
approach.  What I'd recommend is you keep the content in a database or  
in some other type of repository and index that directly with Lucene.   
Access that content with your Struts actions and push it into the  
display using the standard mechanisms for Struts/taglibs.

Is this static content that is just text on JSP pages?  If so, pull the  
content out and put it there dynamically - and decouple the content  
from the presentation, and thusly making indexing much easier and  
sensical.

Is this feasible with what you're doing?  If not, why not?

	Erik

Erik, thanks for replying:

I agree that this makes indexing rather straight forward, but....
then I have to build/use a content management system for my
existing web application(s). That's not going to fly for me right now.
Maybe in the future - but for now, I need to provide content-searching
capability for my web applications.


Why is indexing the site using a crawler not such a good idea for web
applications
where 99% of the content is static? If the content changes, you just rebuild
the indexes. This solution works if I have a legacy web site or one deployed
as a web application. It works if my pages are composite or atomic. It works
if
my content is dynamic or static.

Crawling's a good solution because it's so easy to map the content back to a
URL.  For a CMS, it might be the case that you have content in the
repository that isn't ready to be on the site yet, so it's not published to
a URL.  You'd have to keep track of what content is published to which URL
on the site to build the index properly.

Of course, this all depends on what is content in your system, like you
said. The advantage of crawling is that anything on the web page ends up in
the search engine.  That's also one of the disadvantages.

You can roll your own poor-man's content management system that would 
fit into your web apps just fine.  If the content you truly want 
indexed is one big block of text, for example, just make .txt files for 
each block and then <jsp:include> it where appropriate.  Sure, this 
will involve some connection between the URL and the .txt file.  
Indexing with Lucene then becomes trivial.

I just think it is more of a last resort type of solution, but 
certainly it'll work.

Sure.  But you might also be missing metadata, if that is an important 
piece.  Who is the author of the content?  When was it created?  etc.  
This is all information that you'd lose by crawling, unless you encode 
that with meta tags somehow, or can parse it out.

Thanks again for your insight on this.

:)

I smile because my blog is powered by Lucene, and I'm very particular 
about URL's and how it maps to content.  For example:

	http://www.blogscene.org/erik/Computers/Articles/javanet_jul03.html

This is a dynamically generated (despite the .html extension).  I have 
a servlet mapped to /erik/*.  My blog entries are literally on the file 
system as .txt files (blosxom-style, first line is title, rest is 
body).  The Ant <index> task indexes them based on the relative path 
from the blog root, and each directory is a category, each text file a 
blog.  You'd find this blog by searching like this:

	http://www.blogscene.org/erik?q=%22lucene+intro%22

Tacking on ?flav=rss will give you an RSS feed of a particular query!  
You could also see it as text here:

	http://www.blogscene.org/erik/Computers/Articles/javanet_jul03.txt

(the extension is used to determine the "flavor" presented - text 
format is generated using lynx).

All blog entries in the /Computers/Articles category as an RSS feed:

	http://www.blogscene.org/erik/Computers/Articles?flav=rss

All of the above requests are dynamically using a Lucene PrefixQuery 
based on the URI, and if you use the search box it AND's that with a 
QueryParser parsed query allowing queries restricted to a category and 
below.  Selecting a blog by title is like this:

	http://www.blogscene.org/erik?q=title:intro

I agree that crawling can get the job done, but I'd prefer to integrate 
Lucene at a lower-level with more metadata than just a URL and HTML.  
Lucene *is* the content repository in my blog.

Hi All,

I have a strange problem...I have indexed a couple of Web pages (used 
htmlparser for HTML to text conversion)
and I can see the index created. When I search for a term, lucene returns 
the hits and score. But when I try to
retrieve the document (hits.doc(int)) it gives me the following error

"Exception in thread "main" java.io.IOException: The system cannot find the 
path specified"

   public void index(String uid, String title, String text) {
     try {
       IndexWriter writer = new 
IndexWriter("d:\\tomcat\\webapps\\ROOT\\url_index", analyzer, true);
       Document document = new Document();
       document.add(Field.Keyword("uid", uid));
       document.add(Field.Text("title", title));
       document.add(Field.UnStored("pagebody", text));

       writer.addDocument(document);
     } catch (Exception e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
     }
   }

       	Query query = QueryParser.parse(queryString, "pagebody", new 
StandardAnalyzer());
       	hits = searcher.search(query);
           for (int i=0;i< hits.length();i++) {
          	    Document doc = hits.doc(i);
	    String doctitle = doc.get("title");
	    String url = doc.get("uid");
   	  }
   }

I appreciate your time and help

You might be delighted to know that we used Lucene as our search engine at

You do great work, keep it up!

Hi, I was wondering why Hits is not serializable? It would have been
convenient for me to have it serializable, as the search action is performed
by a session bean in a context other than the one running the
web-application.

Which is your standard way to pass the matching documents between different
context?

For now, I'm going to create a Serializable object (a String[] or a
Collection) but I'm remaining for your reply.

Thanks,

Marco

Hits is really a collection of pointers back to the documents, not a 
standalone collection.

Have a look at ejindex: http://ejindex.sourceforge.net/

Also, have a look at the built-in RemoteSearchable class.  You could 
use it to search over RMI.

But the quickest/easiest way that I've used before is to extract all 
the documents from the hits and wrap it up as a Map and send it back.

That's what I've done so far (in a String[] object).

Thank you for your reply.

Hi , I would like to share with you the solution I chose at the end to
create a search facility for my Struts application. Basically, I followed
the Erik's suggestion to realize something independent from the actual
Struts architectural choice (Tiles, <jsp:include>, and so on), and a couple
of Robert Taylor's email gave me the inspiration. Particularly, I realized
that if I could simulate in someway a request to a Struts Action and write
the response content to a file, well, I had a file ready to be indexed by
Lucene. I had a look at the Java Cookbook, and Darwin gave me the solution:

1) I created a Struts Action which reads all the Actions in the
configuration file which have a parameter forwarding to a jsp page and
creates a collection with those information;

2) I created a Session bean which receives this collection as parameter
(thus, a collection of Action mappings, like
http://myserver/myapp/Login.do), reads the stream for each URL and saves the
content in a file. Here I had a good idea: to name the file with the same
name as the action, only replacing the protocol separator with '@' and the
folder separator with '_' (underscore). The result is a folder with files
containing the real HTML as we would see in the source after visiting a
link, named http@__myserver_myapp_Login.do;

3) I run the real Lucene index, pointing to the folder where all the above
mentioned files are located;

4) I run a query

5) I convert back the returned paths replacing '@' with ':' and '_' with
'/'.

Simple as that: I now have a collection of actions which the user can click
on, which will result in HTML page containing the content the user was
interested in.

This is only the beginning: obviously many optimization may be done: for
instance caching the results, giving the possibility to choose the
separators (both for protocol and folder), organizing the configuration
information in a XML configuration file and so on...

Hope this will help,

Marco

I, too, am very particular about that.

Unfortunately none of the web application frameworks I am aware of
support this philosophy :-(

There are some workarounds such as using mod_rewrite, but so far nothing
really satisfying...

A bit off topic, but I'll indulge myself for at least one more message  
on this.  Here is a fun link I've been saving for a while:

	http://www.pixelcharmer.com/fieldnotes/archives/process_designing/ 
2003/000285.html

(notice their URL is a bit lame :)

True, but I don't use an existing framework for a CMS, which my blog is  
a "lite" version of.  I've done a lot with Struts, and I use it for  
heavy form-based sites and it does the job acceptably well.  Now I'm  
embarking on a relatively large-scale Tapestry project, and its URL's  
are even more ridiculous.  At least with Struts you can control how  
URI's are mapped to ActionServlet, so typically either *.do or /do/*,  
and you have full control over the rest of the URI with the action  
mappings.  There is even wildcard support to map a range of URI's to  
the same Action, which may have already been added to the latest  
codebase.

There is something slightly satisfying about the ease that mod_rewrite  
does its thing though.  I use it, in fact, to map my old blog URL to my  
new one - it is a straightforward domain and path prefix change,  
nothing dramatic though.

Hi, I just wanted to share with you a couple of considerations I made while
implementing the struts-search facility I mentioned in one of my previous
emails.

As you will probably recall, I had the idea to create files with the same
name as the struts-actions (i.e. http@__myserver_myapp_myAction.do). Today I
discovered an inconvenient resulting from this approach: the struts-index
creation will be for most users an 'Administrator' tool, run on the local
server, and we know that a local server where a website is stored, has a
local name, rather than www.myserver.org, for instance myserver, or
prodserver, and so on.

With the above approach, I was creating files with the following name:

http@__myserver_....

So far so good. The problem is that if than we want to show the file name as
a link where the user can click (wisely re-translated into
http://myserver/myapp.... reversing the initial pattern) users who will run
a search from the 'external' word, will be shown with links like:

http://myserver/myapp/Login.do

which obviously won't work. Here we could have many solutions: we could
translate myserver into the domain name, we could substring the URL
substituting the server name with the domain name, but at the end I realized
that the best solution is to use relative URLs. Therefore, at index
creation, when we must say to the application to create the files with the
content retrieved by an openStream() method, we could simply extract the
relative url by invoking the URL.getFile() method on the URL.

This way, we'll have file like: _myapp_Login.do, _myapp_Intro.do and so on.
Giving those names to the <html:link> element in Struts, will result in the
absolute URL being composed, therefore the link will work both from internal
and external users...

Regards,

Marco

Hi,

I've an index : each document is indexed with 2 fields named "content" =
and "title".

To make my search, I use this code :
QueryParser qp =3D new QueryParser("content", analyzer);

My interrogation is :
if I use the QueryParser("content", analyzer) and I make a search like =
this in my query " title : mysearch", is the exact same thing than if I =
use the QueryParser("title", analyzer) and I make the search " mysearch" =
 ?
I suppose that yes, but someone could confirm that?
Is there a methode to make my search automatically with the 2 fields? =
for the moment, I use this code :
        QueryParser qp =3D new QueryParser("content", analyzer);
        qp.setOperator(QueryParser.DEFAULT_OPERATOR_AND);
        query =3D qp.parse("("+queryString+") OR =
title:("+queryString+")");
Is it the good way?


Thanks in advance

Yes, I used it in a quick & dirty app. As a matter of fact, these are
totally orthogonal technologies, you can use lucene, woth struts, webwork,
maverick, jsf. I don't really understand what is the point in the question.

Look for MultiFieldQueryParser.  I believe that is the name of the
class.  You should be able to find it in the online Javadocs.

Hi,

I've an another question.

For indexing my documents I use this code :
writer =3D new IndexWriter(index, new StandardAnalyzer(), create);

I use 2 fields "content" and "title" but I would use diff=E9rents =
Analyzer for this 2 fields (one who could use numerical and the other =
not, for example)
Is there a way to do this?

thanks in advance

S=E9bastien

You can only use one Analyzer per document and all tokenized fields=20
will use that analyzer (an aside, you can change analyzers on a per=20
document basis also).

But, you can create a custom Analyzer that does the right logic on a=20
per-field basis easily by just copying the code from the Analyzers you=20=

want to use in there.  The tokenStream method you override provides the=20=

field name as a parameter.

hi:

*incze
.. i don't really understand what is the point in the question ...

*mark
i guess the point is - my understanding of these technologies is 
incomplete - and i am trying to get up to speed with them.

thanks incze, your comment about them being totally orthogonal is very 
useful.

You can write a custom Analyzer that performs different actions on
different fields.  Check out the FAQ at jGuru for an example.

Hi Reece,
Thank you for the clue.
Based on the document from Otis, if I understand welll, it seems a lower
mergeFactor should be used.

Set the mergefactor to a higher number.

Hi,
I am using Lucene 1.3 rc released on March.20, 2003.
For some reason, the files in the index directory increase very very
quickly for some documents and reach over 3000 files within half hour
and even can not optimize the index.Then it grows up to 33000 files
within one index. In most of other testing cases, it normally never
reach 1000 even without optimization.

Any idea about this?

regards,
Hui

Hello

I am trying to delete all docs in my index containing a field with a =
given value. The API says that the delete( term ) method in IndexReader =
can do that for me. The problem is that it doesn't seem to work =
properly. When i apply the delete( term ) method to docs where i know =
that only one document exists with the given ID, the document is deleted =
as it should be, but when there are more documents with the same ID, =
nothing happens.
It should be said that alle documents have a unique ID and some =
documents furthermore have another ID field called modelTreeFileID, =
which indicates membership to a group of documents.=20

This little code snippet is how I am doing it :

IndexReader ir =3D IndexReader.open( pathToIndex );
Term term =3D new Term( "modelTreeFileID", "324i28383gvvb" );
ir.delete( term );


if only one document was found with the value 324i28383gvvb was found, =
it is deleted, but if more documents were found they are not :-(

Is this a bug in IndexReader or am i doing something wrong.

Any help is appreciated.

Lars,

The code looks fine.  However, you are not showing how you deal with
any possible exceptions (IOExceptions, for instance), so it is possible
that you are ignoring exceptions.
Thata delete(Term) method returns an int, so you could also capture
that and see what its value is.
I assume that you are also closing your IndexReader instance...

Hello - 

I have created 27 separate indices that hold a total of 15.8 million XML
documents.  My question is, would I be better served to have one large index
or multiple indices as I have?  Also does anyone have any sample code of how
I merge these indices?  I have seen the addIndexes(Directory[]) method and
am not quite sure how to implement it.

thanks, 
Tom

Tom,

Not sure which one would be better for you.  It would be easy for you
to test that, though.  My guess would be that a single index will work
better.

To merge indices, create a new instance of FSDirectory.
  Directory dir = new FSDirectory("/path/to/new/index");

Then create an array of your 27 indices (something like the above, but
add it to an array of Directory[] type, and use a different path for
each of your 27 dirs in the ctor above) and pass it to addIndexes
method, like this:
  dir.addIndexes(yourDirectoryArray);

The 'dir' is the 'dir' from above.

Otis

Tom,

Not sure which one would be better for you.  It would be easy for you
to test that, though.  My guess would be that a single index will work
better.

To merge indices, create a new instance of FSDirectory.
  Directory dir = new FSDirectory("/path/to/new/index");

Then create an array of your 27 indices (something like the above, but
add it to an array of Directory[] type, and use a different path for
each of your 27 dirs in the ctor above) and pass it to addIndexes
method, like this:
  dir.addIndexes(yourDirectoryArray);

The 'dir' is the 'dir' from above.

Otis

Sorry I should have posted som more code the first time around, here is the
whole method that i Use. I make a search for the term first to check if any
documents exists :

private void deleteModelTree( String modelTreeFileID, pathToIndex )
    {
        try
        {
            IndexReader ir = IndexReader.open( pathToIndex );

            Term term = new Term( "modelTreeFileID", modelTreeFileID );

            TermQuery query = new TermQuery( term );
            Searcher searcher = new IndexSearcher( pathToIndex );
            Hits hits = searcher.search( query );

            if( hits.length() != 0 )
            {
                ir.delete( term );
            }

            ir.close();
        }
        catch( Exception e )
        {
            e.printStackTrace();
         }
    }

I catch all Execptions to see if anything goes wrong and so far no
excpetions are thrown ....

Hello

 I'm planing to use Lucene in a big environment, with large data sets 
(between 50-100Gb of data). I've seen some people have experience in 
this kind of environments.
 I was wondering, if someone can provide a benchmarking with this amount 
of data.
 
Another question, is someone using Lucene in a distribute environment? 
I'm planing to use it in a distribute environment to manage such amount 
of data. I'm interested in the C++ version (CLucene) too, because I 
think the C++ version is faster (someone has real numbers (in 
performance) between the Java and the C++ version).

Thanks,
Albert.

The lower the number, the more often a new file is created.  Since
creating/opening files with Lucene seems to cause issues on Windows, I
increased this to 100.  This solved my file locking problems and still
gave me good performance (I am able to perform over 200 queries/second
from a servlet being hit from a remote machine).

Hi Reece,
Thank you for the clue.
Based on the document from Otis, if I understand welll, it seems a lower
mergeFactor should be used.

Hi,
I am using Lucene 1.3 rc released on March.20, 2003.
For some reason, the files in the index directory increase very very
quickly for some documents and reach over 3000 files within half hour
and even can not optimize the index.Then it grows up to 33000 files
within one index. In most of other testing cases, it normally never
reach 1000 even without optimization.

Any idea about this?

regards,
Hui

The lower the number, the more often a new file is created.  Since
creating/opening files with Lucene seems to cause issues on Windows, I
increased this to 100.  This solved my file locking problems and still
gave me good performance (I am able to perform over 200 queries/second
from a servlet being hit from a remote machine).

Hi Reece,
Thank you for the clue.
Based on the document from Otis, if I understand welll, it seems a lower
mergeFactor should be used.

Set the mergefactor to a higher number.

Hi,
I am using Lucene 1.3 rc released on March.20, 2003.
For some reason, the files in the index directory increase very very
quickly for some documents and reach over 3000 files within half hour
and even can not optimize the index.Then it grows up to 33000 files
within one index. In most of other testing cases, it normally never
reach 1000 even without optimization.

Any idea about this?

regards,
Hui

We would like to be able to allow our users to browse the index of
searchable terms by entering a term (or term stem) to which we will
respond with a list of words surrounding the entered word/stem (say 10
terms before and 10 terms after) along with the number of occurrences of
the terms in the documents in the database/index.

We're not quite sure how to do that yet, but our initial reading of the
documentation indicates that maybe we should use IndexReader
TermEnum(Term t).  If we are reading this correctly, the method seems to
be uni-directional only (i.e., there is no way to get the immediately
preceding terms to the user entered word/stem).  Is there a way to
retrieve a bi-directional list of terms surrounding a given word/stem?

Thanks,

Joe Paulsen

Thanks for all the replies. I feel reassured with using Lucene. If I end up
doing anything with the application that I'm writing, I would like to look
at contributing some documentation of Lucene's features, and what it has to
offer.

I'm about to start some refactorings on the web application demo that 
ships with Lucene to show off its features and be usable more easily 
and cleanly out of the box - i.e. just drop into Tomcat's webapps 
directory and go.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what they'd like to see in the demo 
app?  Some of my ideas are:

- Eliminate the need to do a command-line indexing, let the web app do 
this upon command, allowing you to specify where the index lives (there 
will be a reasonable default like ~/lucenedemo/index perhaps) and what 
directory tree to index (perhaps defaulting to the root directory or 
c:\, or where instead?)

- Spin off a background indexing thread so the web app searching is 
immediately useful after kicking off the indexing process, and allow a 
status view of the indexing progress.

- Index text and HTML files.  Any others?  I don't want to get into 
putting too many dependencies in though - let's keep it relatively 
simple, although still demonstrative.  Allow search filtering by last 
modified date range and document type (extension).

- Perhaps allow you to specify the analyzer to use when indexing.

- Show the explanation of how scores are computed in the search results 
as an option.

I'm all ears to possibilities of improvements!  Send your wishlist.

please keep the discussions on the lucene-user e-mail list.

of course the source code will be available... what is there is already 
in lucene's CVS and i will just revamp what is there and commit it.  
and when we make lucene releases it will be bundled and made available 
as a single download too.

as for indexing XML files.... that is a possibility, but that is a 
broad request.  how would they be indexed?  every element made a field? 
  every attribute too?  what are the field names?  is this really 
appropriate for a "demo"?

And I've used pdfbox before - its cool.

And I'm cool with adding PDF and Word indexing to the demo personally, 
but I didn't want to increase the "weight" of the demo application.  If 
folks feel strongly about it then I'll incorporate it.

Might want two demos, one for Unix environments and one for Windows.

Most users will want a fast start that they can copy and adapt.  So quick
targets would be:

filesystems - html / text / pdf / office documents for windows.
xml - fairly simple example maybe against news items.
database - again simple maybe a pseudo employee database.
website - accessable from the filesystem.
website - that requires crawling.

Show hit markup.

Again, I'd like to hear more about how you'd do this generically.  Tell

- Spin off a background indexing thread so the web app searching is=20
immediately useful after kicking off the indexing process, and allow a=20

- Index text and HTML files.  Any others?  I don't want to get into=20

I would like to see the taglib for searching the index in the demo. There is
an html form page and result page already built for the taglib that allows
you to change search params and demonstrates a fair amount of the search
capability of Lucene.

Hello all, 

I have recently indexed approx 15.8 million XML documents in which I index
the contents certain elements (titles, states, dates to name a few).  I have
27 separate indices and use a MultiSearcher to search these indices.  

When I search on the title and state fields with multiple terms searching is
very fast.  For example I get a hit count of 227, 000 in .4 seconds.  But
when I throw a date range in the search, performance suffers significantly.


My query would look something like this: LongTitle:killeen AND
LongTitle:state AND StateDistrict:id AND FiledDate:["1997-01-01" TO
"2002-04-04"] and it returned in 
5.7 seconds


Does anyone have any suggestions for searching date ranges.  Our ranges will
generally be between a 3 - 7 year period.

thanks, 
Tom

Hello all, 

I have recently indexed approx 15.8 million XML documents in which I index
the contents certain elements (titles, states, dates to name a few).  I have
27 separate indices and use a MultiSearcher to search these indices.  

When I search on the title and state fields with multiple terms searching is
very fast.  For example I get a hit count of 227, 000 in .4 seconds.  But
when I throw a date range in the search, performance suffers significantly.


My query would look something like this: LongTitle:killeen AND
LongTitle:state AND StateDistrict:id AND FiledDate:["1997-01-01" TO
"2002-04-04"] and it returned in 
5.7 seconds


Does anyone have any suggestions for searching date ranges.  Our ranges will
generally be between a 3 - 7 year period.

thanks, 
Tom

Hi,

Here are a couple of ideas for XML demos:

1. simply index the content into one 'content' field. Don't worry about
attributes.

2. index a linked Dublin core meta data file:
<link rel="meta" href="index.rdf" />
And add fields for every element after rdf:Description

Best,
-Rob

I don't know how lucene handles date ranges, but I was having very poor
results using booleans between different because of the way lucene handles
them.  What lucene does is that it evaluates each field in the query
separately and retrieves all of the results, then it evaluates the boolean
joins between the different fields.

So I believe the way lucene is handling the query is:

Get all the documents whose LongTitle has killeen in them
Get all the documents whose LongTitle has state in them
Get all the documents whose StateDistrict has id in them
Get all the documents filed between 1997-01-01 and 2002-04-04

(This, incidently, takes up a huge amount of memory)

Finally, it evaluates the booleans figures out which documents satisfy all
of your criteria and returns that to you.


I'm working on a matching engine that takes company information like their
name and address and finds our record for that company.  I ended up making a
separate index for every state and country because it was running too slow
and running out of memory when I was using booleans between fields. 

Maybe you could do something similar with your dates.  (i.e. one index per
year)

Hi All,

has someone ever written an extension of QueryParser providing the
possibility to let wildcard search terms be run through an analyzer ( =
as
suggested by Tatu Saloranta a while ago)? I want to reduce german =
umlauts to
their base letters (eg. '=E4' (&auml;) to 'a' ) and for non-wildcard =
queries
my UmlautFilter does its job. Or is there any other option?

Many thanks,
Ren=E9

Hi All,

has someone ever written an extension of QueryParser providing the
possibility to let wildcard search terms be run through an analyzer ( =
as
suggested by Tatu Saloranta a while ago)? I want to reduce german =
umlauts to
their base letters (eg. '=E4' (&auml;) to 'a' ) and for non-wildcard =
queries
my UmlautFilter does its job. Or is there any other option?

Many thanks,
Ren=E9

Apparently Lucene expands ranges to boolean 'or' queries. So if you have
a thousand distinct dates within a range, Lucene will build a query with
a thousand terms...

One workaround is to first run the query, but without ranges. Store the
results into a bit vector with the position corresponding to the
document id. Then create a TermEnum that starts with the lower range
value. For each term, get the document ids, and set the corresponding
values in a second bit vector. Break the loop as soon as the TermEnum
has reached or passed the upper limit of the range. Finally, 'and' or
'or' the second bit vector with the first one. It's as simple as that
:-)

I wonder why Lucene doesn't use this strategy by default. I realize it
is less efficient when the range includes few terms, but it seems to
scale far better.

Show how lucene can 1) do incremental indexing, 2) isn't restricted to
indexing file system resources and 3) can store and query arbitrary
fields. These are in my opinion the features where most other search
engines fall flat.

I think all the attribute values together with element text values should be
indexed in the "content" part. Also a xml map file could be used to pick up
the nodes need to be indexed separately so we do not create too many fields
by indexing non-critical nodes separately. Simple xpath could be used for
the map source, the field name and index type should be the map target.

Hui

A word of warning: PDFBox is fantastic, I agree - but some PDFs are not 
so... In my application I experienced numerous hangs when PDFBox would 
start parsing some PDFs (I can send the files to Ben if required), and 
then got stuck in an infinite wait somewhere... So I came up with a 
workaround: I run the parser in a separate thread, while waiting in the 
main thread, and then after a certain timeout I kill the processing 
thread and return.

Bryan, no offense... but I won't be using the taglib in the demo.  I 
just don't feel accessing a Lucene index via a taglib is the right way 
to do things.  Coupling an index to JSP in that manner is too tight for 
my tastes.  What happens if you want to use Velocity for presentation?  
Or a Swing app?  See what I mean?

Like I communicated in a previous thread, indexing JSP's just has a 
"smell" to it for me.  I can't argue with the pragmatic way others have 
done it by crawling, but I don't think of JSP's as "content" and I'd 
rather index actual content, that may or may not be later presented 
within a JSP.

If you use the same date range repeatedly then you can make things fast 
by replacing it with a filter that you re-use.  Try using a QueryFilter 
with your date range query as the query.  Save the QueryFilter object 
and use it again with future queries.  The first query will be slow, but 
subsequent queries will use the cached results of the first.

This is the recommended way to implement a "within the last month", 
"within the last year", etc. feature.  You could even pre-fetch the 
filter whenever you update the index, by evaluating a query before you 
put a new IndexReader in production, so that even the first real user 
query is fast.

If you use the same date range repeatedly then you can make things fast 
by replacing it with a filter that you re-use.  Try using a QueryFilter 
with your date range query as the query.  Save the QueryFilter object 
and use it again with future queries.  The first query will be slow, but 
subsequent queries will use the cached results of the first.

This is the recommended way to implement a "within the last month", 
"within the last year", etc. feature.  You could even pre-fetch the 
filter whenever you update the index, by evaluating a query before you 
put a new IndexReader in production, so that even the first real user 
query is fast.

And with the latest Lucene codebase in CVS, you could also use a 
DateFilter wrapped inside a CachingWrapperFilter instead of a 
QueryFilter.  Just wanted to mention what is now available.

But I'll reiterate what Doug says... be sure to save off the filter 
instance so you don't take the filtering performance hit for the same 
date ranges on later searches.

I've run across some puzzling behavior regarding scoring.  I have a set =
of documents which contain, among others, a date field (whose contents =
is a string in the YYYYMMDD format).  When I query on the date 20030917 =
(that is, today), I get 157 hits, all of which have a score of =
.23000652.  If I use 20030916 (yesterday), I get 197 hits, each of which =
has a score of .22295427.

So far, all seems logical.  However, when I search for all records for =
the date 20030915, the first two (of 174 hits) have a score of 1.0, =
while all the rest of the hits have a score of .03125.  Here is a =
tabulation of these and a few more queries:

Query Date      Result
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D        =
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
20030917        all have a score of .23000652 (157)
20030916        all have a score of .22295427 (197)
20030915        first 2 have a 1.0 score, all rest are .03125 (174)
20030914        all have a score of .21384604 (264)
20030913        first 2 have a 1.0 score, all rest are .03125 (156)
20030912        all have a score .2166833 (241)
20030911        first 3 have a 1.0 score, all rest are .03125 (244)
20030910        all have a score of  .2208193 (211)

I would expect that all the hits would have the same score, and I would =
expect it to be normalized to 1 (unless, I guess, the top score was less =
than 1, in which case normalization presumably doesn't occur). =20

Does anyone have any ideas as to what might be going on here?  (I'm =
using the latest CVS sources, obtained this afternoon.)

Regards,

Terry

Try using IndexSearcher.explain and dump out the contents of what it 
returns either as toString or toHtml (whichever format suits your 
environment best) and see what it has to say.  It'll give you the 
low-down on the factors involved in the score calculation.  I'm 
interested to see what you come up with.

If you're using RangeQuery to do date searching, then you'll likely see 
unusual scoring.  The IDF of a date, like any other term, is inversely 
related to the number of documents with that date.  So documents whose 
dates are rare will score higher, which is probably not what you intend.

Using a Filter for date searching is one way to remove dates from the 
scoring calculation.  Another is to provide a Similarity implementation 
that gives an IDF of 1.0 for terms from your date field, e.g., something 
like:

public class MySimilarity extends DefaultSimilarity {
   public float idf(Term term, Searcher searcher) throws IOException {
     if (term.field() == "date") {
       return 1.0f;
     } else {
       return super.idf(term, searcher);
     }
   }
}

Or you could just give date clauses of your query a very small boost 
(e.g., .0001) so that other clauses dominate the scoring.

Doug/Erik,

I do use RangeQuery to get a range of dates, but in this case I'm just
getting a single date (string), so I believe it's just a regular query I'm
using.

Per Erik's suggestion, I checked out the Explanation for some of these

Doug/Erik,

I do use RangeQuery to get a range of dates, but in this case I'm just
getting a single date (string), so I believe it's just a regular query I'm
using.

Per Erik's suggestion, I checked out the Explanation for some of these
anomolies.  I've included a condensation of the data it generated below
(which I don't frankly don't understand).  Perhaps that will give you or
Erik some insight into what's happening?

Terry

It looks like the fieldNorm's are what differ, not the IDFs.  These are 
the product of the document and/or field boost, and 1/sqrt(numTerms) 
where numTerms is the number of terms in the "pub_date" field of the 
document.  Thus if each document is only assigned one date, and you 
didn't boost the field or the document when you indexed it, this should 
be 1.0.  But if the document has two dates, then this would be 
1/sqrt(2).  Or if you boosted this document pub_date field, then this 
will have whatever boost you provided.

So, did you boost anything when indexing?  Or could a single document 
have two or more different values for pub_date?  Either would explain this.

Doug

It looks like the fieldNorm's are what differ, not the IDFs.  These are 
the product of the document and/or field boost, and 1/sqrt(numTerms) 
where numTerms is the number of terms in the "pub_date" field of the 
document.  Thus if each document is only assigned one date, and you 
didn't boost the field or the document when you indexed it, this should 
be 1.0.  But if the document has two dates, then this would be 
1/sqrt(2).  Or if you boosted this document pub_date field, then this 
will have whatever boost you provided.

So, did you boost anything when indexing?  Or could a single document 
have two or more different values for pub_date?  Either would explain this.

Subject: Lucene demo ideas?

I'm about to start some refactorings on the web application demo that 
ships with Lucene to show off its features and be usable more easily 
and cleanly out of the box - i.e. just drop into Tomcat's webapps 
directory and go.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what they'd like to see in the demo 
app?  Some of my ideas are:

- Eliminate the need to do a command-line indexing, let the web app do 
this upon command, allowing you to specify where the index lives (there 
will be a reasonable default like ~/lucenedemo/index perhaps) and what 
directory tree to index (perhaps defaulting to the root directory or 
c:\, or where instead?)

- Spin off a background indexing thread so the web app searching is 
immediately useful after kicking off the indexing process, and allow a 
status view of the indexing progress.

- Index text and HTML files.  Any others?  I don't want to get into 
putting too many dependencies in though - let's keep it relatively 
simple, although still demonstrative.  Allow search filtering by last 
modified date range and document type (extension).

- Perhaps allow you to specify the analyzer to use when indexing.

- Show the explanation of how scores are computed in the search results 
as an option.

I'm all ears to possibilities of improvements!  Send your wishlist.

Doug,

(1) No, I did *not* boost the pub_date field, either in the indexing process
or in the query itself.

(2) And, each pub_date field of each document (which is in XML format)
contains only one instance of the date string.

(3) And only the pub_date field itself is indexed.  There are other
attributes of this field that may contain the date string, but they aren't
indexed - that is, they are not included in the instantiated Document class.

Regards,

Terry

Perhaps just one generic "content" field, which would contain tokenized
content from all XML segments. That could be done easily & efficiently
with just sax event handling? Since it's a simple demo, you can't get much
simpler than that, but it should still be fairly useful?
Attributes could/should be ignored by default; common practice for XML markup
seems to be for attributes not to contain any content that would make sense to 
index.

So I'd think just stripping out all tags (and comments, PIs etc) might be 
reasonable plain simple approach for demo app.

If I may plug our code again ;-) Docco (http://tockit.sf.net) contains a 
framework for document handlers, with implementations for plain text, 
html, xml and OpenOffice based on JDK 1.4 and plugins for PDFBox, POI 
and Multivalent. There is also a notion of file mappings (i.e. mapping 
from a match on a FileFilter to a handler) and we plan to add code to 
mixin external information like meta-data stores or EAs from advanced 
file systems. It is available on SF (within 
http://sf.net/projects/toscanaj) and is at the moment BSD-style 
licensed. We would be happy to contribute bits of that and thanks to the 
plugin architecture dependencies should be controllable. Admittably the 
plugin loader is still a hack, but it works.

Doug,

I just extracted a portion of the database, reindexed and found the scores
to come out much more like we'd expect.  Appears this may be an indexing
issue - I index new stuff each day and merge the new index with the master
index.  Only redo the master when I can't avoid it (because it takes so
long).  I probably merge 100 times or more before reindexing.  This evening
I'll reindex and let you know if the apparent problem clears up.  If so,
I'll keep track of it as I continue to merge and see if there's any issue
there.

Thanks for the input (and from Erik, pointing me to the Explanation - it's
pretty neat).

Question: The new scores for the test database portion mentioned above all
seem to come out in the range of .06 to .07.  I assume this is because they
never get normalized.  If this is the case, (a) would it hurt anything to
"normalize up" (so the scores range up to 1), and if so (b) is there an
easy, non-disruptive (to the source code) way to do this?

Regards,

Terry

Amit, this is a question for the -user list, not -dev list.

I suggest that you look at one of Lucene articles that deal with
indexing.  You will find links to them on the Resources page, which is
listed on Lucene's home page.

Amit, this is a question for the -user list, not -dev list.

I suggest that you look at one of Lucene articles that deal with
indexing.  You will find links to them on the Resources page, which is
listed on Lucene's home page.

I know, I know, the HTML Parser in the demo is just that (i.e. a demo), but 
I also know that it is updated from time to time and performs much better 
than the other ones that I have tested.  Frustratingly, the very first page 
I tried to parse failed 
(<http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/54/32593.html>http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/54/32593.html). 
It seems to be choking on tags that are being written inside of JavaScript 
code (i.e. document.write('</scr' + 'ipt>');.  Obviously, the simple 
solution (that I am using with another parser) is to just ignore everything 
inside of <script> tags.  It appears that the parser is ignoring text 
inside script tags, but it seems like it needs to be a bit smarter (or 
maybe dumber) about how it deals with this (so it doesn't get confused by 
such occurrences).  I see a bug has been filed regarding trouble parsing 
JavaScript, has anyone given it thought?

Outside of the HTML parsing, all is well (and outside of a few pages, the 
parser is a champ).

Thanks!

I would guess that often ignoring stuff in <script> (for indexing purposes) 
makes sense; exception being if someone wants to create HTML site creation 
IDE (like specifically wants to search for stuff in javascript sections?).
Nonetheless HTML parser has to be able to handle these I think.

> confused by such occurrences).  I see a bug has been filed regarding

I implemented a rather robust (X[HT])ML parser ("QnD") that was able to work
through many of such issues (<script> tag, unquoted single '&' and '<' chars,
in attr values and elements, simplistic approach to optional end tags). Since 
it was dead-optimized for speed (anything fully in memory in a char array, 
optimizing based on that) I thought it might be useful for indexing (even 
more so than for its original purpose which was to be very fast utility for 
filtering [adding and/or removing stuff] of HTML pages).

If anyone would be interested I could give the source code and/or (if I have 
time) to implement efficient fault-tolerant indexer.
Like I said this also works equally well for well-formed XML, but that's 
nothing special.

We had reasonably good experiences with this simple bit of code, using 
Swing's HTML parser:

  
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/toscanaj/docco/source/org/tockit/docco/documenthandler/HtmlDocumentHandler.java?rev=1.4&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup

We haven't tested it much, but it does grok a local copy of the link given.

Here is our XML parsing code:

http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/toscanaj/docco/source/org/tockit/docco/documenthandler/XmlDocumentHandler.java?rev=1.6&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/toscanaj/docco/source/org/tockit/docco/documenthandler/SaxTextContentParser.java?rev=1.3&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup

The XML bit is not too good yet. E.g. it chokes on large XML easily 
since it reads all content into memory at once.

Some of the code will require JDK 1.4, though. The XML relies on JAXP, I 
don't know about the HTMLEditorKit.

JTidy seems to be another option.

We had reasonably good experiences with this simple bit of code, using 
Swing's HTML parser:

  
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/toscanaj/docco/source/org/tockit/docco/documenthandler/HtmlDocumentHandler.java?rev=1.4&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup

We haven't tested it much, but it does grok a local copy of the link given.

Here is our XML parsing code:

http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/toscanaj/docco/source/org/tockit/docco/documenthandler/XmlDocumentHandler.java?rev=1.6&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/toscanaj/docco/source/org/tockit/docco/documenthandler/SaxTextContentParser.java?rev=1.3&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup

The XML bit is not too good yet. E.g. it chokes on large XML easily 
since it reads all content into memory at once.

Some of the code will require JDK 1.4, though. The XML relies on JAXP, I 
don't know about the HTMLEditorKit.

JTidy seems to be another option.

all,
when i'm trying to run my index writer program at idea (IDE) i got this error (cant rename segments.new to segments, sometimes the deletable file got an error), but when im going to run the program in the command prompt, it looks fine, no error returned.
 
im just making 1 index and no threads
is this a bug?

Fortunately, the sole purpose of the parser that ships with Lucene is 
indexing HTML documents.  As such, I see no reason to worry about 
functionality for other use cases (i.e. IDE development).  There are plenty 
of other parsers out there that try to be complete.  It would be great if 
this one was optimized for the task at hand (and thus can ignore text 
inside <script> tags).

I'd definitely be interested to see what you did.  My application needs to 
index "public" documents as users submit requests (eventually 1000's per 
day), so I don't have control over the HTML (i.e. it needs to be fault 
tolerant) and it needs to be efficient.  Parsing a big page (i.e. 
http://www.mysql.com/documentation/mysql/bychapter/manual_Reference.html) 
is another good way to stress the basic parsers (some are frighteningly CPU 
intensive).

Even though I think a solid HTML parser that is optimized for the task of 
indexing is actually quite important to Lucene, we can take any further 
discussions off-line as they are probably not deemed relevant to the Lucene 
list.

-Mike

Hi,
I am wondering whether we could do some changes for the feature Lucene.
1. Move the Analyzer down to field level from document level so some fields
could be applied a specail analyzer.Other fields still use the default
analyzer from the document level.
For example, I do not need to index the number for the "content" field. It
helps me reduce the index size a lot when I have some excel files. But I
always need the "created_date" to be indexed though it is a number field.

I know there are some workarounds put in the group, but I think it should be
a good feature to have.

2. Does it affect the performance/space a lot if I use the large max length
for the field like 1000000(Normally only "content" need that.) If so, could
we make this parameter associated with "field" rather than "document"?

3. Based on the
document(http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/03/05/lucene.html) from
Otic(It is really great! ), the mergeFactor control when we put the indexed
documents into one segment and merge the segments into one big segment. For
Windows, larger mergeFactor could cause the "Too many files open" problem
when merging the segments. But the lower mergeFactor slows down the
indexing. Could we export two different parameters here? One is  to control
when we put the files into one segment in the disk so I can set it larger
when the machine has enough memory; another one is to control when merge the
segments.
Right now it is the power of the mergeFactor.

Regards,
Hui

Hi,
I am wondering whether we could do some changes for the feature Lucene.
1. Move the Analyzer down to field level from document level so some fields
could be applied a specail analyzer.Other fields still use the default
analyzer from the document level.
For example, I do not need to index the number for the "content" field. It
helps me reduce the index size a lot when I have some excel files. But I
always need the "created_date" to be indexed though it is a number field.

I know there are some workarounds put in the group, but I think it should be
a good feature to have.

2. Does it affect the performance/space a lot if I use the large max length
for the field like 1000000(Normally only "content" need that.) If so, could
we make this parameter associated with "field" rather than "document"?

3. Based on the
document(http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/03/05/lucene.html) from
Otic(It is really great! ), the mergeFactor control when we put the indexed
documents into one segment and merge the segments into one big segment. For
Windows, larger mergeFactor could cause the "Too many files open" problem
when merging the segments. But the lower mergeFactor slows down the
indexing. Could we export two different parameters here? One is  to control
when we put the files into one segment in the disk so I can set it larger
when the machine has enough memory; another one is to control when merge the
segments.
Right now it is the power of the mergeFactor.

Regards,
Hui

Hi Fundu People

I'm a newbie in this and hence please bear with my FADQ(D==Dumb)(I'm for
some reasons not able to download the lucene-user Digest till now) The demo
I tried from apache performs the search from command line well however it
gives a list of null results when we try to load it from war file ,we are
using weblogic8.1 ,any clues?.

Secondly we want to display some description relevant to searched pages ,one
solution we have thought is of creating a cache(HashMap) ,with the absolute
URL of pages as key and description(parsed by using some parser to parse
HTML pages using <description tag>) Could someone suggest a better
solution(this one doesn't seems right) or point myself to some already
implemented solutions

Thanks

This occurs for me on Windows XP when the mergefactor is low or when
there is more than one reader or writer open.  Try increasing the
mergefactor.  Also, don't open and close the writer after each document.
Open the writer once, index all your docs and then close the writer.
You'll have much better success!

error (cant rename segments.new to segments, sometimes the deletable
file got an error), but when im going to run the program in the command
prompt, it looks fine, no error returned.

I've only heard of the issue on Windows - I believe a patch from Matt Tucker was actually 
incorporated into Lucene that made some attempt to work around this issue.

The "workaround" is to write a custom analyzer and and have it do the 
desired thing per-field.

Hmmm.... just thinking out loud here without knowing if this is 
possible, but could a generic "wrapper" Analyzer be written that allows 
other analyzers to be used under the covers based on a field 
name/analyzer mapping?   If so, that would be quite cool and save folks 
from having to write custom analyzers as much to handle this pretty 
typical use-case.  I'll look into this more in the very near future 
personally, but feel free to have a look at this yourself and see what 
you can come up with.

I'm going to swap in the neko HTML parser for the demo refactorings I'm  
doing.  I would be all for replacing the demo HTML parser with this.

If you look at the Ant <index> task in the sandbox, you'll see that I  
used JTidy for it and it works well, but I've heard that neko is faster  
and better so I'll give it a try.

I'm going to swap in the neko HTML parser for the demo refactorings I'm  
doing.  I would be all for replacing the demo HTML parser with this.

If you look at the Ant <index> task in the sandbox, you'll see that I  
used JTidy for it and it works well, but I've heard that neko is faster  
and better so I'll give it a try.

I've only heard of the issue on Windows - I believe a patch from Matt Tucker was actually 
incorporated into Lucene that made some attempt to work around this issue.

What about something like this?

public class PerFieldWrapperAnalyzer extends Analyzer {
   private Analyzer defaultAnalyzer;
   private Map analyzerMap = new HashMap();


   public PerFieldWrapperAnalyzer(Analyzer defaultAnalyzer) {
     this.defaultAnalyzer = defaultAnalyzer;
   }

   public void addAnalyzer(String fieldName, Analyzer analyzer) {
     analyzerMap.put(fieldName, analyzer);
   }

   public TokenStream tokenStream(String fieldName, Reader reader) {
     Analyzer analyzer = (Analyzer) analyzerMap.get(fieldName);
     if (analyzer == null) {
       analyzer = defaultAnalyzer;
     }

     return analyzer.tokenStream(fieldName, reader);
   }
}

This would allow you to construct a single analyzer out of others, on a 
per-field basis, including a default one for any fields that do not 
have a special one.  Whether the constructor should take the map or the 
addAnalyzer method is implemented is debatable, but I prefer the 
addAnalyzer way.  Maybe addAnalyzer could return 'this' so you could 
chain: new PerFieldWrapperAnalyzer(new 
StandardAnalyzer).addAnalyzer("field1", new 
WhitespaceAnalyzer()).addAnalyzer(.....).  And I'm more inclined to 
call this thing PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper instead.  Any naming 
suggestions?

This simple little class would seem to be the answer to a very common 
question asked.

Thoughts?  Should this be made part of the core?

Erik,

Probably a good idea to swap something else in, although Neko introduces a 
dependency on Xerces.  I didn't play with Neko because I am currently using 
a different XML parser and didn't want to deal with the conflicts (and also 
find dependencies on specific parsers annoying).  However, yesterday I 
downloaded TagSoup(http://mercury.ccil.org/~cowan/XML/tagsoup/) and it is 
great!  It is small and fast and so far has parsed every page I've thrown 
at it.  I wrote a SAX ContentHandler that only grabs the text and does a 
few other little things (like inserting spaces, removing tabs/line feeds, 
grabbing title) and it seems to be a perfect fit for the job.  It requires 
the SAX framework, but is parser independent.  The only tweak I made to the 
TagSoup code was to add an "else" to deal with a bug where it was consuming 
";" after entities that it did not deal with.

If Neko is potentially headed into the Apache fold, that probably makes 
sense.  But if you are interested in my TagSoup ContentHandler for testing 
it out, just let me know.

-Mike

sense.  But if you are interested in my TagSoup ContentHandler for testing

I've only heard of the issue on Windows - I believe a patch from Matt
Tucker was actually
incorporated into Lucene that made some attempt to work around this
issue.

Query query = new TermQuery(new Term("modified", 
DateField.dateToString(date));

You could also do this with QueryParser expressions, although there are 
some caveats to date fields and its usage (must use default locale 
short date format strings, for instance).

About a month ago, timeouts were added to Lock (and they seem to make a =
lot of good sense).  However, because of this enhancement, in using the =
latest CVS my application broke - I keep getting the message "Lock =
obtain timed out".  I looked through the source in an attempt to figure =
out a quick way to set something to provide backward compatibility, but =
it didn't leap out at me. =20

Does anyone know of a simple way to do this?

Regards,

Terry

Hi there,

I wish to run an pre analyzer that help me to choice the right analyzer 
I wish to run on my stream.
For instance i wish to analyze the language of my text and choice then 
an language dependent stop word remover.
Since it is a token stream an my language detection need the whole text 
to identify the language, how to implement a pre Analyzer?

I wish to do something like a pipeline.

Thanks for any hints.

Stefan

Doug,

Well, my good intentions (to reindex on Thursday night) were interrupted by
Hurricaine Isabel (followed by a 44 hour power outtage).

Well, excuses aside, I did get the reindex done today and the scores for all
hits from a single date query come out to be the same score (as they
should).  Don't have any idea what screwed up the previous index - though as
promised, I'll keep an eye on it as I continue to merge new stuff over the
next few days/weeks.

Is there a way, using standard Lucene configuration parameters and/or API's,
to force the hit scores to come out so the highest one is set to 1, and the
others are proportionately lower?

Regards,

Terry

I'm currently using the MultiFieldQueryParser to search across four fields. 
I'm searching for phrases so i've wrapped my search text in quotes... 
everything worked
fine until i tried to execute a search ending with the 'A' and for some 
reason the A and quotes are ignored e.g.:


Analyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer();
Searcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(IndexReader.open("dbindex"));

String[] fields = {"code_field", "short_description_field", 
"category_field", "manufacturer_field"};
int[] flags = {MultiFieldQueryParser.NORMAL_FIELD, 
MultiFieldQueryParser.NORMAL_FIELD, MultiFieldQueryParser.NORMAL_FIELD, 
MultiFieldQueryParser.NORMAL_FIELD};

Query query =    MultiFieldQueryParser.parse("\"Category A\"", fields, 
flags, analyzer);

System.out.println("query -> " + query);

Hits hits = searcher.search(query);



The System output for the above is as follows:
code_field:category short_description_field:category category_field:category 
manufacturer_field:category



If i execute the same code with the following search text i get the expected 
results:
Query query =    MultiFieldQueryParser.parse("\"Category Z\"", fields, 
flags, analyzer);


code_field:"category z" short_description_field:"category z" 
category_field:"category z" manufacturer_field:"category z"



I' appreicate any help with regards this matter...

StandardAnalyzer removes stop words and "a" is one of them.  That is 
why you have issues with that phrase.

My personal take is using the date support in Lucene is not all that 
fun or easy because of the contortions necessary to deal with it.  But, 
QueryParser supports date field ranges (but not a term query by date 
field).  So, you can do it this way:

	date:[1/1/04 TO 1/1/04] for inclusive date ranges (only 1/1/04 found)
	date:{1/1/04 TO 1/5/04} for exclusive ranges (dates 1/2, 1/3, and 
1/4/04 are found, but not 1/1 or 1/5/04)

To give the user the possibility to assign a higher weight to a term in a
query, (by using a term weight or by repeating the term).
The norm_q compensates the total score for the query weights,
leaving the scores of two different queries somewhat comparable.

Hi,
   
  I found that lucene is a full-featured text search engine. Is it 
possible to make it for numeric search. In my appl. I need to look 
in to the index for score=75.

Hi,

I have to develop a distributed search engine for my company. I�m very 
interested with the Lucene index format, and I want to use it. The main 
problem is how to distribute the index in the different machines.

The solution is not just copy the index, because I have to manage 50Gb 
of data. I want to distribute the index in a more efficient way, I�ve 
thought the best was doing it by document, by field or by term.

For example, I can distribute half the data by document, having 
documents in one computer and other documents in another (that�s the 
simplest way, but you have to send a query to all the servers).

Another way is distribute the index by field (I work only with XML data, 
so a field will be a Xml element), having one field in one server, and 
another one in other. This version seems more efficient because you only 
have to send the query depending what field the user want to search.

The last solution is distribute the index by term. Then you only have to 
send the query to those servers containing this term. Using the field 
and term solution, I don�t want to distribute the documents with the 
index (because on document can contain a lot of terms, and I don�t want 
to distribute the same document in all the computers), just the 
documentID, and have the pair <documentID, document> in another computer.

I�m planning to have an indexing server, which will be in charge of 
indexing the data and then distribute it over the n backend servers 
(depending if the distribution is per document, per field or per term; 
the indexing server will have to look the lucene index and distribute 
only the needed parts). Then, the search server will know these 
distribution and will only send the queries to the appropriate servers.

I want a include replication in order to increase the fiability as well.

Any comments, suggestions and/or problems. Do you think It is a 
realistic/good solution?

Thanks,

Albert

Hi,

I have to develop a distributed search engine for my company. I�m very 
interested with the Lucene index format, and I want to use it. The main 
problem is how to distribute the index in the different machines.

The solution is not just copy the index, because I have to manage 50Gb 
of data. I want to distribute the index in a more efficient way, I�ve 
thought the best was doing it by document, by field or by term.

For example, I can distribute half the data by document, having 
documents in one computer and other documents in another (that�s the 
simplest way, but you have to send a query to all the servers).

Another way is distribute the index by field (I work only with XML data, 
so a field will be a Xml element), having one field in one server, and 
another one in other. This version seems more efficient because you only 
have to send the query depending what field the user want to search.

The last solution is distribute the index by term. Then you only have to 
send the query to those servers containing this term. Using the field 
and term solution, I don�t want to distribute the documents with the 
index (because on document can contain a lot of terms, and I don�t want 
to distribute the same document in all the computers), just the 
documentID, and have the pair <documentID, document> in another computer.

I�m planning to have an indexing server, which will be in charge of 
indexing the data and then distribute it over the n backend servers 
(depending if the distribution is per document, per field or per term; 
the indexing server will have to look the lucene index and distribute 
only the needed parts). Then, the search server will know these 
distribution and will only send the queries to the appropriate servers.

I want a include replication in order to increase the fiability as well.

Any comments, suggestions and/or problems. Do you think It is a 
realistic/good solution?

Thanks,

Albert

TagSoup is great - however, it is not maintained nor developed (the same 
could be said about JTidy as well, but TagSoup's history is much 
shorter...). I'm using HTMLParser (http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net) 
for my application, and it also works very well, even for ill-formed 
input. It's also very actively developed.

Yes, you can do numeric searches as long as you realize its really just 
text that is indexed.  You will need to ensure the Analyzer you use 
indexes numbers appropriately as well.

Yeah, I was using HTMLParser for a few days until I tried to parse a 400K 
document and it spun at 100% CPU for a very long time.  It is tolerant of 
bad HTML, but does not appear to scale.  TagSoup processed the same 
document in a second or less at <25% CPU.

You can also use a RangeQuery.  If you index the field of numeric data, say
'score', as a string, then you can do things like: score:[75 TO 80].  Only
extra work is that you need to pad the actual score with enough 0's (such
that 9 becomes 09, etc.) to cover the expected range.

Terry

Hi there.  I've got an index of company names, and it's split up into
separate indexes by state.

I have a simple command line interface for testing.  I'm getting some odd
results, though, with certain logic of wildcard searches.  It seems like
depending on what order I put the fields of the query in alters the results
drastically when I AND them together.

Here are some examples:

***************************
This one makes sense

Query> name:amb*
State> california
name:amb*
org.apache.lucene.search.PrefixQuery@2d086a
amb*
2819 total matching documents 

***************************
This is the REALLY confusing one.  We know there's a company named AMB
Property Corporation.  Why do I get NO hits?

Query> name:"amb prop*"
State> california
name:"amb prop*"
org.apache.lucene.search.PhraseQuery@20dda
"amb prop"
0 total matching documents

***************************
Ok, so I get some results with this (I know the * isn't neccessary at the
end of property, but bear with me for the next example where it goes all
screwy)

Query> name:amb property*
State> california
name:amb property*
org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery@10b053
amb name:amb property*:property*
56 total matching documents

***************************
south san francisco is an exact match to the city.  Why does this find 0
results??!

Query> name:amb property* AND city:south san francisco

Hi there.  I've got an index of company names, and it's split up into
separate indexes by state.

I have a simple command line interface for testing.  I'm getting some odd
results, though, with certain logic of wildcard searches.  It seems like
depending on what order I put the fields of the query in alters the results
drastically when I AND them together.

Here are some examples:

***************************
This one makes sense

Query> name:amb*
State> california
name:amb*
org.apache.lucene.search.PrefixQuery@2d086a
amb*
2819 total matching documents 

***************************
This is the REALLY confusing one.  We know there's a company named AMB
Property Corporation.  Why do I get NO hits?

Query> name:"amb prop*"
State> california
name:"amb prop*"
org.apache.lucene.search.PhraseQuery@20dda
"amb prop"
0 total matching documents

***************************
Ok, so I get some results with this (I know the * isn't neccessary at the
end of property, but bear with me for the next example where it goes all
screwy)

Query> name:amb property*
State> california
name:amb property*
org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery@10b053
amb name:amb property*:property*
56 total matching documents

***************************
south san francisco is an exact match to the city.  Why does this find 0
results??!

Query> name:amb property* AND city:south san francisco
State> california
name:amb property* AND city:south san francisco
org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery@283b8a
amb +name:amb property* AND city:south san francisco:property* +city:south

Ah, this is a fun one.... lots of fiddly issues with how queries work 
and how QueryParser works.  I'll take a stab at some of these inline 
below....

Interesting interface.  Looks like something that if made generic 
enough would be handy to have at least in the sandbox.

not all your queries are truly "WildcardQuery"'s though.  look at the 
class it constructed to get a better idea of what is happening.

Not quite the right explanation of what is happening.  More below....

Right.... QueryParser does a little optimization here and anything with 
a simple trailing * turns into a PrefixQuery, meaning all name fields 
that begin with "amb".

Notice you're now in PhraseQuery land.  Wildcards don't work like you 
seem to expect here.  What is really happening here is a query for 
documents that have "amb" and "prop" terms side by side in that order.  
The asterisk got axed by the analyzer.  If you said "name:amb 
name:prop*" you'd get some hits I believe, as it would turn into a 
boolean query with a term and wildcard queries either OR'd or AND'd 
together.  PhraseQuery does not support wildcards.  A custom subclass 
of QueryParser could do some interesting things here and expand 
wildcard-like terms like this in a phrase into PhrasePrefixQuery, but 
that is probably overkill here (although maybe not).  Look at the test 
case for PhrasePrefixQuery for some hints.

your default field for QueryParser is "property*"?  Odd field name, or 
is the output fishy?  I'm a bit confused by the "property*:" there.  
I'm assuming you're outputting the Query.toString here.

See above for a different way to phrase the query.

with all the AND's going on, this makes sense because "san" and 
"francisco" end up as separate term queries.  you'd have to say 
city:"south san francisco" to turn it into a PhraseQuery.

you're getting hits on the wildcard match at least, and probably on 
name field "amb" as well.  again, phrase queries don't support 
wildcards like you've done here with "south san fran*" so you're not 
matching anything with that.

my guess here is you're getting hits on "south san" as a phrase query.  
are there that many in that area?

you're getting zero hits from "amb propert*" since * is getting 
stripped by the analyzer and there is no "amb propert" phrase match, 
and with the AND (which should be all uppercase, right?) definitely not 
getting hits.

You didn't quite flip it around, you took off some quotes too, which 
removed a PhraseQuery and you're getting your hits from name:amb here 
as well as probably the wildcard of propert*.  I'm still confused by 
the output of propert*: here - are you using the CVS version of Lucene? 
  the toString looks ok there, maybe there was a bug in that method in 
earlier code?

Notice this is a TermQuery - thats the clue... the asterisk is taken 
literally there, so no matches.

Now you kicked it into an optimized wildcard query, which turns into a 
prefix query, hence the matches.

your clue here is that the toString output has the asterisks removed, 
so your analyzer stripped them.  again quotes mean phrase query.  
phrase queries don't support wildcards.

I hope my above analysis helps.  I may not be perfectly right on 
everything, but should be relatively close at identifying the issues.  
Fixing it is more up to how you want to deal with it.  Perhaps a custom 
QueryParser is more what you're after.

you're getting hits on the wildcard match at least, and probably on 
name field "amb" as well.  again, phrase queries don't support 
wildcards like you've done here with "south san fran*" so you're not 
matching anything with that.

> 10732 total matching documents

my guess here is you're getting hits on "south san" as a phrase query.  
are there that many in that area?

you're getting zero hits from "amb propert*" since * is getting 
stripped by the analyzer and there is no "amb propert" phrase match, 
and with the AND (which should be all uppercase, right?) definitely not 
getting hits.

You didn't quite flip it around, you took off some quotes too, which 
removed a PhraseQuery and you're getting your hits from name:amb here 
as well as probably the wildcard of propert*.  I'm still confused by 
the output of propert*: here - are you using the CVS version of Lucene? 
  the toString looks ok there, maybe there was a bug in that method in 
earlier code?

Notice this is a TermQuery - thats the clue... the asterisk is taken 
literally there, so no matches.

Now you kicked it into an optimized wildcard query, which turns into a 
prefix query, hence the matches.

your clue here is that the toString output has the asterisks removed, 
so your analyzer stripped them.  again quotes mean phrase query.  
phrase queries don't support wildcards.

I hope my above analysis helps.  I may not be perfectly right on 
everything, but should be relatively close at identifying the issues.  
Fixing it is more up to how you want to deal with it.  Perhaps a custom 
QueryParser is more what you're after.

Hi,

what is the purpose of "tf_q * idf_t / norm_q" in Lucene's scoring 
algorithm:
score_d = sum_t( tf_q * idf_t / norm_q * tf_d * idf_t / norm_d_t)

I dont understand, why the score has to be higher, when the frequency of a 
term in the query is higher. What is normalized by "norm_q"?

Thanks,
Chris

     One odd thought (may be out of scope) is to put together a
google-flavored query language, since most users are going to be
unfamiliar with the default Lucene query language.  Lucene doesn't
really match google, but something google-flavored might be better at
showing off Lucene's features in the demo.

I'm storing data with a hierarchical classification in a Lucene index,
if that is what you mean.

The approach is very simple. Every document has a field for a unique
identifier, a field for the identifier of its immediate parent, and a
field for those of all ancestors. This allows you to write queries such
as "name:human ancestor:2759" to find organisms that have "human" in
their name, and are Eukaryotes (but not, say, viruses).

This approach also allows you to efficiently display search results in a
tree, even for very large result sets, as long as the hierarchy doesn't
get to flat.

One drawback of this approach is that doing incremental updates is not
possible, or at least very complicated (duplicated information in the
ancestor field), and you must be careful about the order in which you
add documents to the index (parent before child).

Let me know if you are interested in any further details.

Hui,

Concerning an other point of your request list I proposed a patch this week
end on the lucene-dev list and i totally forgot that this feature was
requested on the user list.

This new feature should help you to set a number of Documents to be merged
in memory independently of the mergeFactor.

Any comments would be appreciated

Best regards

Julien Nioche

Sujet  : [PATCH] IndexWriter : controling the number of Docs merged

Hello,

Someone made a suggestion yesterday about adding a variable to IndexWriter
in
order to control the number of Documents merged in RAMDirectory
independently of
the mergeFactor. (I'm sorry I don't remember who exactly and the mail
arrived at
my office).
I'm proposing a tiny modification of IndexWriter to add this functionality.
A
variable minMergeDocs specifies the number of Documents to be merged in
memory
before starting a new Segment. The mergeFactor still control the number of
Segments created in the Directory and thus it's possible to avoid the file
number limitation problem.

The diff file is attached.

As noticed by Dmitry and Erik there are no true JUnit tests. I'd be OK to
write
a JUnit test for this feature. The problem is that the SegmentInfos field is
private in IndexWriter and can't be used to check the number and size of the
Segments. I ran a test using the infoStream variable of IndexWriter -
everything
seems to be OK.

Any comments / suggestions are welcome.

Regards

Julien

Erik's analysis is comprehensive and useful.  I think this example reflects
a common (and understandable) oversight - that wildcards do *not* work with
a phrase.  Got caught on that many times myself.  Also there may be
confusion about the format -> field:(term1 term2), in that the examples
provided don't seem to make use a parentheses.  Finally, as I recall, there
was some bug(s) with some wildcard patterns with 1.2.

Regards,

Terry

Erik's analysis is comprehensive and useful.  I think this example reflects
a common (and understandable) oversight - that wildcards do *not* work with
a phrase.  Got caught on that many times myself.  Also there may be
confusion about the format -> field:(term1 term2), in that the examples
provided don't seem to make use a parentheses.  Finally, as I recall, there
was some bug(s) with some wildcard patterns with 1.2.

Regards,

Terry

Yeah, thanks a lot for your help!  I'm using the release version of Lucene
version 1.2.

Yeah, I printed the queries out to see what was going on and noticed that.
I used wildcard in the subject as a sort of general description of what I
was after rather than its technical meaning to lucene, but I was curious
about why I was getting the query types I was getting.  

> your default field for QueryParser is "property*"?  Odd field name, or 
> is the output fishy?  I'm a bit confused by the "property*:" there.  
> I'm assuming you're outputting the Query.toString here.

That's just the Query.toString, yeah.  I didn't set any default fields to
property* so whatever it's spitting out comes from the QueryParser.

>> Query> name:amb propert* and city:"south san fran*"

> you're getting hits on the wildcard match at least, and probably on

Ok... What's the correct procedure for doing a multi-word wildcard where I
want it to begin with "south san fran" but not get anything else that
contains "south" or "san"?  Just and together the south, san, and fran?  

Although this might produce good results, my understanding was that booleans
retrieve all matches and store them in memory then resolve the booleans.  If
I use the term "san" to search California, I'm going to need a lot of memory
to store all of the temporary results...!  

Or is that only true when doing booleans on different fields?  If so, I
think we have our solution! :)

The honest to goodness 1.2 release. :)

Well, i think the real key piece of information was to drop the quotes to
avoid the phrase queries.  Thanks!

about why I was getting the query types I was getting.

That's just the Query.toString, yeah.  I didn't set any default fields to
property* so whatever it's spitting out comes from the QueryParser.

>> Query> name:amb propert* and city:"south san fran*"

Ok... What's the correct procedure for doing a multi-word wildcard where I
want it to begin with "south san fran" but not get anything else that
contains "south" or "san"?  Just and together the south, san, and fran?  

Although this might produce good results, my understanding was that booleans
retrieve all matches and store them in memory then resolve the booleans.  If
I use the term "san" to search California, I'm going to need a lot of memory
to store all of the temporary results...!  

Or is that only true when doing booleans on different fields?  If so, I
think we have our solution! :)

The honest to goodness 1.2 release. :)

Well, i think the real key piece of information was to drop the quotes to
avoid the phrase queries.  Thanks!

Your email prompted me to re-read the query parser documentation.  There are
only two examples using parentheses, which seem to be the answer to my
questions.  They are:

 (jakarta OR apache) AND website 

And

title:(+return +"pink panther")


These leave a lot unanswered, though.  I mean, for example, what would
happen if the query were:

title:(+return +pink panther)
or 
title:(return*pink panther)

I.e. are the + or booleans required between each word inside the
parentheses?

I guess the answer is that I need to just play with it and find out, but as
others have mentioned, the documentation is lacking in some respects and I'd
say this is one of them... Maybe I'll submit some answers when I figure them
out. :)

Better yet, submit some JUnit test cases that show how this stuff 
works, if the ones in Lucene's codebase aren't comprehensive enough.  
This is an excellent way to "play" with an API and get a good 
understanding of it and documenting it at the same time.

Hi folks, 

I have been using Lucene for a while. Our application needs to sort 
the result set by last modified date. I was really happy to see SearchBean
and
HitsIterator. 

My question is that can I use SearchBean for search using Multiple indices. 
I skimmed through the souce code but could not find any method to search 
using Multiple indices or an array of Directories.

Can anyone help me. Thanks in advance.

Hi folks, 

I have been using Lucene for a while. Our application needs to sort 
the result set by last modified date. I was really happy to see SearchBean
and
HitsIterator. 

My question is that can I use SearchBean for search using Multiple indices. 
I skimmed through the souce code but could not find any method to search 
using Multiple indices or an array of Directories.

Can anyone help me. Thanks in advance.

As far as I know there isn't a way to do this with QueryParser 
currently.  The real way to do this with the existing API is to use 
PhrasePrefixQuery and do some manual setup before using it (like you'll 
see in the current test case and Javadocs for it) by enumerating all 
the terms that start with "fran" and passing that to a 
PhrasePrefixQuery (isn't this class misnamed?  What does this have to 
do with "prefix"?) along with "south" and "san".

+south +san +fran* ought to do the trick.  i wouldn't worry about 
memory too much until you've seen it to be a problem.  i think you'll 
be fine (but don't currently have the understanding or data to back 
that up).

It's our intention to put this into a production environment soon, so we
were waiting on 1.3 to go final before attempting to use it.

The reason I split up the indexes by state was that I was running out of
memory (and searches were very slow) with the whole world of companies in
one index with all kinds of boolean joining.  With it split out, it seems to
do pretty well.

Well, after some extremely brief experimentation (Maybe I shoulda done it
before writing the email, huh?)  I discovered this:

**********************
This worked pretty well and got me some good results - the company that I
was looking for came back second (Which is pretty good given how general I
made the query)

Query> name:(amb proper*)
State> california
name:(amb proper*)
org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery@a992f
amb proper*
31988 total matching documents

*************
This one matched a ton of documents, however the company I was looking for
came up first in the list, though with a pretty abysmal score of 0.23769014

Query> name:(amb prop*) and city:(south san fran*)
State> california
name:(amb prop*) and city:(south san fran*)
org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery@34bb5
(amb prop*) (city:south city:san city:fran*)
721977 total matching documents

****************
The previous query took 1552 millis.  I was able to reduce that to 285
millis just by adding the +'s you suggested:

Query> name:(amb prop*) and city:(+south +san +fran*)
State> california
name:(amb prop*) and city:(+south +san +fran*)
org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery@6d4c1
(amb prop*) (+city:south +city:san +city:fran*)
45011 total matching documents


Incidently, I say everything that I do with great awe at the power of Lucene
and respect for those who have made it possible.  Please don't take anything
I say as a gripe - I'm just learning how things work and that's a neccessary
step to take for any new software package of this type.  You just have to
learn the ins and outs and little quirks to be able to take full advantage
of it.  

Thanks!

Well, what about a very old fashioned way instead? Something like 
tar.gz.ftp? Not very glamourous, but workable...

I, like a lot of other people are new to Lucene.  Practical examples
are pretty scarce.

I have the following site:

http://www.tasteofwhatcom.com

It's built on JBoss 3.0.7/Tomcat 4.1.24, Apache 2.0.47/mod_jk 1.2.4,
MySQL 3.23.57 and RedHat 9.0.

I want to add search capabilites to the site to allow users to
search for entries.  All the menu items are in various MySQL
tables.  In addition some information is in static html and jsp
pages.  Some links are to PDF docs on the site.

How do you create a Lucene index on 'menu items' in the database as
well as the static pages both html and jsp, and any PDF docs that
are linked?  Are there any examples?

Thanks,

Jack

If you don't mind learning by example, take a look at the "Powered by 
Lucene" page. A fair number of those projects are open source.

Are these fields and their values added during the index operation? I
mean is it possible to add in the fields at a later time (ie after
indexing). What about updating the fields?=20

It seems like I have to remove the index item and then re-index it in
again?

Hello,

we use Lucene 1.2 to index data of a content management system on a
solaris machine.

Our problem is that the segments file seems not to be up to date. When
the IndexWriter.optimize() method is used, a FileNotFoundException is
thrown. The file that is looked for does not exist.

This issue was posted before, but it has not been answered yet. So I
try it again. Here is the stacktrace of the exception:

java.io.FileNotFoundException: /var/spool/www/index/otv/_19bi.fnm (No such file or directory)

        at de.blueorange.xred.search.LuceneIndexer.run(LuceneIndexer.java:306)
        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:479)


There are several other files which are not found.

What could be the cause of the old entries in the segments file? Maybe
there is a problem with concurrent reading and writing threads?


Thanks a lot
Hanna

Unfortunately, yes. The problem is that it is not possible to modify
individual index fields with Lucene, and I am not aware of any
workaround.

Hi!

I use a GermanAnalyzer for indexing and searching, search for "der" ("the") 
does not return any hits. But examining the index with Luke does show up 
"der" as the top ranked word. Other word which are probably stop words as 
well ("zum") return hits.

bug?

Hi!

I search in a field called "url". url:www.blah.com does return hits while 
url:blah.com does not. So I tried url:*blah.com but this does even throw a 
ParseException.

What am I doing wrong?

Wildcards at the beginning of a term are not supported. Lucene use the first
characters to speedup the search for matching terms (== words). So the query
parser doesn't accept you query. (Afterwise lucene has to examine all terms
and this would be very slow).
You may use a second field to store the url as invered string, e.g.
invurl: moc.halb.www and search for invurl:moc.halb.* instead.
Checkout the archives for both mailing lists (lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org
and lucene-dev@jakarta.apache.org). IRC there are other proposals discussed
serveral time ago to workaround this limit.

	Wolf-Dietrich

Wildcards at the beginning of a term are not supported. Lucene use the first
characters to speedup the search for matching terms (== words). So the query
parser doesn't accept you query. (Afterwise lucene has to examine all terms
and this would be very slow).
You may use a second field to store the url as invered string, e.g.
invurl: moc.halb.www and search for invurl:moc.halb.* instead.
Checkout the archives for both mailing lists (lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org
and lucene-dev@jakarta.apache.org). IRC there are other proposals discussed
serveral time ago to workaround this limit.
Regards,
	Wolf-Dietrich

Hi!

I search in a field called "url". url:www.blah.com does return hits while 
url:blah.com does not. So I tried url:*blah.com but this does even throw a 
ParseException.

What am I doing wrong?

Timo

Yes, you can use lucene to search French documents. The snowball stemmers contribution contains a 
French stemmer - you'll find it athttp://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/lucene-sandbox/snowball/

Hi!
How can I find out how many words of a document have been indexed?

Text of my document: "Lucene is great"
Indexed: 'Lucene','great'
...should return '2'.

Thanks in advance. Carsten

Hi!
How can I find out how many words of a document have been indexed?

Text of my document: "Lucene is great"
Indexed: 'Lucene','great'
...should return '2'.

Thanks in advance. Carsten

Hello
I use lucene to index a big database (3 millions of articles).
When i search the ref number 1423* all is fine but when i search the 142* =
i have a java.lang.outofmemory.
I've read here that it is because a too big number of possibilities (for e=
xemple 1420000001, 142000000A etc) and not because of too much hits.
So i wonder if it possible to redefine the wildcards in lucene to make the=
m replace only numbers and not caracters .

Thanks for your advices and excuse me for my poor english

This looks very slick!  I'd guess you'd not be interested in 
open-sourcing what you've done, but here's an idea to consider - use 
the free edition as an open source contribution to Lucene's codebase as 
a demo application :))  You'd get a lot of publicity for your 
commercial versions!

Thanks Eric.

I definitely like the idea of including the FREE Edition's WAR file to 
the Lucene code base as a demo application. On one hand, it demonstrates 
the power of Lucene and on the other, as you have already pointed out, 
it will give SearchBlox a lot of publicity.

Let me know how we can take this further.

We would require the source code itself to be included in Apache's CVS 
repository for it to be included.  I'm in the midst of revamping the 
Lucene demo application, but your application certainly far supersedes 
any plans I had for it, so searchblox would make for an excellent 
replacement.

All the editions of SearchBlox are built on the same code base and 
releasing the source code to Lucene will have a adverse impact on our 
commercial versions with the business model we are adopting at the moment.

Well, it was worth a try :)

And I definitely understand your position.  The demo app of Lucene will

Well, it was worth a try :)

And I definitely understand your position.  The demo app of Lucene will 
hopefully eventually evolve into something like a searchbox-lite type 
of application.

Hi all,

I have written a Lucene Analyzer for arabic. You will find it here :
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/pierrick.brihaye/ArabicAnalyzer.jar (provisional
adress, anybody interested in hosting it ?)

This work is still in beta stage but it gives quite good results :-)

In order to make it work, you need :

1) a 1.4+ JVM (because of the native support for regular expressions which
are heavily used in the program ; I've been too lazy to use an external
package)

2) Apache Jakarta Commons-Collections :
http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/collections.html

3) a recent Lucene distribution ;-)

All this work is based on the amazing Tim Buckwalter's Arabic Morphological
Analyzer Version 1.0
(http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2002L49)
originaly written in Perl and released under the GPL.

The jar contains :

a) the compiled classes
b) the required data files (dictionaries and compatibility tables)
c) 2 command-line test programs
d) 3 test documents with different encodings
e) the source code
f) a README file that will give you a little bit more of information :-)

To Lucene developers : I plan to offer this work to Lucene (see the jar
hierarchy... and the source file headers ;-). Any objections ?

Feedback is very welcome : there are quite a lot of unresolved issues, with
the analyzer itselfs as well as with Lucene.

mE AlslAmap, cheers,

p.b.

We could put this in the Lucene sandbox CVS perhaps.  Could you package  
it similarly to the other contributions there with a build file and  
convert your command-line tests to JUnit tests that run from the build  
file?

I took a quick look and looks like you did a fair bit of work and have  
the ASL in the source files.  The question, though, is whether your  
basing it on GPL code is acceptable.  Did you copy code from it?  We  
can have no GPL code in Apache's CVS.

Yes... but you'll have to wait :-)

And also on this point. The 2 CLI programs are rather "demonstration"
programs than real test cases that could demonstrate the current pending
issues.

Yes... at least in the source files that are based on my own work.

> The question, though, is whether your

As I said, it is based on Tim's Buckwalter work : original Perl program as
well as those precious dictionary files.

> We can have no GPL code in Apache's CVS.

:-/ How can we do, so ? Shall I split the packages in two parts ? No
problems for the "Lucene bindings". But there could be one for the aramorph
package (java port of the original work), which is based on work originally
ruled by the GPL...

Cheers,

Hi,

And also on this point. The 2 CLI programs are rather "demonstration"
programs than real test cases that could demonstrate the current pending
issues.

Yes... at least in the source files that are based on my own work.

As I said, it is based on Tim's Buckwalter work : original Perl program as
well as those precious dictionary files.

:-/ How can we do, so ? Shall I split the packages in two parts ? No
problems for the "Lucene bindings". But there could be one for the aramorph
package (java port of the original work), which is based on work originally
ruled by the GPL...

Cheers,

Since you ported GPL code, aren't you required to GPL your version as 
well?  I'm not a lawyer and not clear on how this works.  You can use 
reflection to "link" to GPL code from Apache code, but I don't think 
you can directly import GPL'd packages (again, I'm not clear on this 
though).

The safest bet is to just host what you've done on your own or at 
Sourceforge or java.net.  It probably wouldn't be a bad idea to have 
some type of repository of Lucene extensions hosted elsewhere anyway to 
solve the GPL issue.

I think so : the aramorph package should be GPLed IMHO. The rest, i.e. my
own code, can be given to Lucene :-)

Or elsewhere :-) The main objective is to use this analyzer within SDX :

Totally agree !

So... it is an ASL infringement from my part to have prepended
"org.apache.lucene" to the aramorph package :-) ?

Well, there are no rules or legalese about restricting package naming 
conventions anywhere that I know of (in or out of Apache) except for 
the java.* and sun.* that is built-into Java itself that can seal these 
out from use.  So there is probably no problem using that package name 
on GPL'd code.

There may be no legal objection, but is it considered a good idea to
appropriate the namespace? If you don't own a domain and your name isn't
common, then I'd suggest using a package such as
org.pierrick.brihaye.aramorph. Alternatively you could be more creative. As
far as I know, there are no restrictions on package names except those
imposed on directory names. So you don't need to start with 'org' or 'com'.
How about coder.pierrick.brihaye.aramorph?

There may be no legal objection, but is it considered a good idea to
appropriate the namespace? If you don't own a domain and your name isn't
common, then I'd suggest using a package such as
org.pierrick.brihaye.aramorph. Alternatively you could be more creative. As
far as I know, there are no restrictions on package names except those
imposed on directory names. So you don't need to start with 'org' or 'com'.
How about coder.pierrick.brihaye.aramorph?

Is it possible to contact Tim, and ask if he will allow you to license
his code under an Apache style license?  Many authors are accomodating
with licensing software under different licenses.

I have personal worries about including GPL code in any commercial
application (even dynamically linked).

Thanks for the advices (more to come on Monday I presume). I think it will
help to take my decision.

See http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#IfInterpreterIsGPL:

"A consequence is that if you choose to use GPL'd Perl modules or Java
classes in your program, you must release the program in a
GPL-compatible way, regardless of the license used in the Perl or Java
interpreter that the combined Perl or Java program will run on."

MySQL AB, for instance, insists that you buy a license for their JDBC
driver if you intend to use it in a non-GPL application...

Hi All,

I'm looking for a way to implement simultaneous left and right =
truncation.=20

The goal is to enable the user to search for e.g. "*hydronaphth*" and =
find
"hexahydronaphthalene" as well as "heptahydronaphthalin".

To achieve that functionality, I'd like to index terms in the way that =
from
a token "foobar" the tokens "oobar" and "obar" ( e.g. mininum word =
length =3D
4)
would be derived and added to the index. I tried to extend TokenFilter, =
but=20
all I get is either "oobar" or "obar", depends on when 'return' is =
called.=20

How could I add such extra tokens to the tokenStream? Any thoughts on =
this
appreciated.

Best regards,

Ren=E9 Hackl

My understanding is that the best way to do this is to create an extra =
field
that is reversed.  That way you store foobar and raboof, and when =
someone
wants to do a left-wildcard, you search in the reversed field so that =
they
search for:

*bar

And you reverse that and perform a search on the reversed field for:

rab*

And find your foobar.

Right, so I got all confused with the chemistry -- That solution won't =
work.

If you're just allowing them to do wildcards by tokenizing on the =
syntax of
chemistry, then you could split the words up according to that..

   public ChemicalOrSomethingFilter(TokenStream input){
     super(input);

   private String getNextTruncation() {		
     StringBuffer emittedText = new StringBuffer();
     //left trim the token
     while(true) {
       if (receivedText.length() == 0) break;
       char c = receivedText.charAt(0);
       if (!Character.isWhitespace(c)) break;

   }

       emittedText = getNextPart();			
       //Warning : all tokens are emitted with the *same* offset

}

Not tested at all : it is a quick copy of my "WhiteSpaceFilter" (that's 
why triming is so important up there ;-) which is not the best designed 
class.

This should work for indexing. For querying, it's another matter 
especially if you want to use the queryParser.

Hi.

In your the method "next", I think there is a "null pointer exception"
threat.


	       //New token ?
       if (receivedText.length() =3D=3D 0) {//<-- null pointer =
exception may
occur here
         receivedToken =3D input.next();		=09
         if (receivedToken =3D=3D null) return null; 	// if the pointer
was null, null exception occured while checking the "length" property =
above
									//
if you know the pointer cant be null, this test is not useful. Or maybe =
I
messed something ?
         receivedText.append(receivedToken.termText());	=09
         positionIncrement =3D 1;	=09
       }

isn't this one more secure ?

	       //New token ?
	if (receivedToken =3D=3D null) return null;
	if (receivedText.length() =3D=3D 0) {
         receivedToken =3D input.next();		=09
         receivedText.append(receivedToken.termText());	=09
         positionIncrement =3D 1;	=09
       }


Hope I did not miss anything, and my remark will be useful.

Gilles.

WildcardQuery, if used directly but not through QueryParser, allows for 
left and right wildcards like this.  Performance is the biggest concern 
though, as it will have to enumerate all terms in the index to look for 
matches.

This is an interesting approach and would certainly give you the search 
results you are looking for, except that you'll be indexing a ton of 
terms I'd guess.  If there is some other way to split these words by 
separating by prefix ("hexa", "hepta") and suffix ("alene", "alin") it 
would likely be better.  But maybe its not practical to do so.

But, to the main question....

> appreciated.

Yes, this can be done.  Craig Walls did this with an example Analyzer 
in his December '02 Java Developer's Journal article.  I adapted his 
example to use to demonstrate this for presentations.  Here is my code:

import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Enumeration;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.ResourceBundle;
import java.util.Stack;
import java.util.StringTokenizer;

import org.apache.lucene.analysis.Token;
import org.apache.lucene.analysis.TokenFilter;
import org.apache.lucene.analysis.TokenStream;

public class AliasFilter extends TokenFilter {
   private static HashMap aliasMap = new HashMap();

   static {
       aliasMap.put("country","yeehaw");
       aliasMap.put("western","rawhide");
   }

   private Stack currentTokenAliases;

   public AliasFilter(TokenStream in) {
     currentTokenAliases = new Stack();
     input = in;
   }

   public Token next() throws IOException {
     if(currentTokenAliases.size() > 0) {
       return (Token)currentTokenAliases.pop();
     }

     Token nextToken = input.next();
     addAliasesToStack(nextToken, currentTokenAliases);

     return nextToken;
   }

   private void addAliasesToStack(Token token, Stack aliasStack) {
     if(token == null) return;

     String aliasString = (String)aliasMap.get(token.termText());

     if(aliasString == null || aliasString.length() < 1) return;

     StringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(aliasString, " ");
     while(tokenizer.hasMoreElements()) {
       String nextAlias = tokenizer.nextToken();
       Token nextTokenAlias = new Token(nextAlias, 0, 
nextAlias.length());
       aliasStack.push(nextTokenAlias);
     }
   }
}

Note that this is a braindead example of injecting tokens into the 
stream, so when "country" or "western" is encountered, another token is 
added to the stream.  In your case you'll do something with the initial 
token and push all its 4+ length pieces onto the stack.

	Erik

WildcardQuery, if used directly but not through QueryParser, allows for 
left and right wildcards like this.  Performance is the biggest concern 
though, as it will have to enumerate all terms in the index to look for 
matches.

This is an interesting approach and would certainly give you the search 
results you are looking for, except that you'll be indexing a ton of 
terms I'd guess.  If there is some other way to split these words by 
separating by prefix ("hexa", "hepta") and suffix ("alene", "alin") it 
would likely be better.  But maybe its not practical to do so.

But, to the main question....

Yes, this can be done.  Craig Walls did this with an example Analyzer 
in his December '02 Java Developer's Journal article.  I adapted his 
example to use to demonstrate this for presentations.  Here is my code:

import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Enumeration;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.ResourceBundle;
import java.util.Stack;
import java.util.StringTokenizer;

import org.apache.lucene.analysis.Token;
import org.apache.lucene.analysis.TokenFilter;
import org.apache.lucene.analysis.TokenStream;

public class AliasFilter extends TokenFilter {
   private static HashMap aliasMap = new HashMap();

   static {
       aliasMap.put("country","yeehaw");
       aliasMap.put("western","rawhide");
   }

   private Stack currentTokenAliases;

   public AliasFilter(TokenStream in) {
     currentTokenAliases = new Stack();
     input = in;
   }

   public Token next() throws IOException {
     if(currentTokenAliases.size() > 0) {
       return (Token)currentTokenAliases.pop();
     }

     Token nextToken = input.next();
     addAliasesToStack(nextToken, currentTokenAliases);

     return nextToken;
   }

   private void addAliasesToStack(Token token, Stack aliasStack) {
     if(token == null) return;

     String aliasString = (String)aliasMap.get(token.termText());

     if(aliasString == null || aliasString.length() < 1) return;

     StringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(aliasString, " ");
     while(tokenizer.hasMoreElements()) {
       String nextAlias = tokenizer.nextToken();
       Token nextTokenAlias = new Token(nextAlias, 0, 
nextAlias.length());
       aliasStack.push(nextTokenAlias);
     }
   }
}

Note that this is a braindead example of injecting tokens into the 
stream, so when "country" or "western" is encountered, another token is 
added to the stream.  In your case you'll do something with the initial 
token and push all its 4+ length pieces onto the stack.

I don't think so. The aim of this method is to "substream" the main 
stream :-) i.e. output several tokens when just one is received (see 
thread's object).

In other terms, we shall not consume a token until the current token is 
itself entirely consumed, i.e. receivedText.length() == 0.

When the currentToken is consumed, we shall immediately return null if 
we receive a null Token (i.e. EOS). That's why this statement is 
*inside* a successful test for current token consumption.

I must reckognize that the use of a string buffer is maybe not the best 
way to do. I must also reckognize that I have to be *very* confident in 
the getNextTruncation() method :-)

Well, my code snippet was to demonstrate :

1) how a "substream" can be handled (remember : I tried to extend 
TokenFilter, but all I get is either "oobar" or "obar", depends on when 
'return' is called)

2) how these tokens will be meited at the same position, thus permitting 
efficient queries.

Cheers,

There'll be at least two indexes, one "normal" one and another bloated =
one.
Dan suggested splitting, too, but, unfortunately, if users search for =
e.g.

"9-Oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nona-2,6-diene"

they don't want anything else than that substance, as opposed to=20

"*-Oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nona*"=20

where they'd be interested in substances from that family - whatever =

But consider the same type of thing like a phrase query.  If two 
documents are indexed with a field containing "a b c" and "x b y"

If searching for "b" is done, both documents are returned.  If 
searching for "a b" is done, then only the first document is returned.  
So I think with a domain aware analyzer, you might be able to split 
things up into separate terms and then on the querying side of things 
the same type of analysis would be done  Certainly not a trivial thing, 
and maybe not even the right approach, but it seems that intelligent 
analysis can make things a lot easier on users and performance for 
searching.  Maybe?  Just food for thought.

But consider the same type of thing like a phrase query.  If two 
documents are indexed with a field containing "a b c" and "x b y"

If searching for "b" is done, both documents are returned.  If 
searching for "a b" is done, then only the first document is returned.  
So I think with a domain aware analyzer, you might be able to split 
things up into separate terms and then on the querying side of things 
the same type of analysis would be done  Certainly not a trivial thing, 
and maybe not even the right approach, but it seems that intelligent 
analysis can make things a lot easier on users and performance for 
searching.  Maybe?  Just food for thought.

As Erik says, it seems that you basically want a PhraseQuery.

At first glance you should tokenize on "-" to have the "words" of your
"phrase".

Then, when you have a number, i.e. "9", "[3.3.1]", "2,6", you could output
"dummy tokens" that would take *one* position, say "NUMBER_ALONE",
"NUMBER_BETWEEN_BACKETS", "COMMA_SEPARATED_NUMBERS"... or just "NUMBER".

When you process :

"hexahydronaphthalene" tokenize it as : "hexa hydro naphtal ene".
"heptahydronaphthalin" tokenize it as : "hepta hydro naphtal in".
The PhraseQuery "hydronaphtal", tokenized by the same tokenizer as "hydro
naphtal" will match both in a PhraseQuery.

Sorry, my knowledge in organic chemistry is far :-) and I wonder if these
considerations are not over-simplistic. Maybe your "same position" approach
(solved by a "token stack" algorithm) is the least worse one.

Exciting analysis problematics however,

Cherrs,

p.b.

what about bi/tri-grams + some sort of hit filtering? It will do the 
job. I just saw some ineffective implementation of 1-grams for CJK on 
lucene-dev@. It could be a good starting point for full n-gram 
support... Just a thought.

A PhraseQuery would do - and certainly perform much better - if I could

formulas into the right tokens. Sometimes however only the context =
makes

are
hundreds if not thousands of possible constituents (like "bi", "tri",
"penta", "hexa" etc. ).

2. users do not only enter queries in terms of the smallest possible
constituents, but also combinations of these, for instance
Q:"*hydronaphthalene*". If the resulting answer set contains
"hydro-something-naphtalene" this will raise eyebrows.

What is more, the index will consist of english and german documents.
Therefore it would be nice to put a wildcard at the right place and get =
hits
in both languages.

Yes, we thought about some kind of n-gram support. At first glance =
though we
couldn't see how to reduce the noise efficiently, but if there's time, =
I'll
give it a try.

As for the AliasFilter class: when I realized how easy it would be to =

A change in the AliasFilter seemed to work:

private void addAliasesToStack(Token token, Stack aliasStack) {
     if(token =3D=3D null) return;

     String tokenString =3D token.termText();
     String tokenSubString =3D "";
              =20
     // --- from here --- =20
     int x =3D 0;    =20
     while( tokenString.length() > x+2 ) {     =09
     	tokenSubString +=3D tokenString.substring( x, x+3 );
     	tokenSubString +=3D " ";     =09
     	x++;     	=09
     }
     // --- to here ---

     //System.out.println( "SUBSTRING ELEMENTS: "+tokenSubString );

     StringTokenizer tokenizer =3D new StringTokenizer(tokenSubString, =
" ");
     while(tokenizer.hasMoreElements()) {
       String nextAlias =3D tokenizer.nextToken();      =20
       Token nextTokenAlias =3D new Token(nextAlias, 0, =
nextAlias.length());

       aliasStack.push(nextTokenAlias);
     }
   }

This snippet creates overlapping tri-grams. But I don't know if this is =
of
any use, a mere notion.

I just reinstalled my system, and can't seem to find lucene 1.3 for
download ? 
What's that new cgi for downloading jakarta files ?

Can anyone tell me where to get it ? 

Thanks a lot !
