Hmm. Sorry, I was a bit unprecise (at least in the quoted part) so I'm 
not sure, if I got that correctly. Access over NFS is readonly, but 
there would be write access on the NFS server itself (local filesystem).
Is this ok? Or should I use a "update a copy of the index and exchange
indexes afterwards" strategy?

TIA

Hi,
  If you only want to compile QueryParser.jj,that's easy.First you must
download the javaCC,then unzip it .add the directory(suppose c:\javacc) c:
\javacc\bin to your path
then you can use command javacc -option QueryParser.jj ,it will generate 7
java files.
          good luck

No additional classes have been created.
The functionality was simply implemented via new properties and method overloading, so original signatures remain intact.

As far as supporting future versions, I cannot say as I will no longer be using it at work.  Keeping the c# version in line with java would have to be done in my own time, so no guarantees.

Taking the 1.2b2 source I only brought in the fixes, enhancements, etc that affected how I was using Lucene.  I keep up with the nightly builds on a regular basis and update the c# source where appropriate, so any bugs should have been rectified.

The functionality was simply implemented via new properties and method overloading, so original signatures remain intact.

As far as supporting future versions, I cannot say as I will no longer be using it at work.  Keeping the c# version in line with java would have to be done in my own time, so no guarantees.

Taking the 1.2b2 source I only brought in the fixes, enhancements, etc that affected how I was using Lucene.  I keep up with the nightly builds on a regular basis and update the c# source where appropriate, so any bugs should have been rectified.

Ok, would be possible the next scenary?

1. We run an IndeWriter and several IndexSearch runs in parallel.
IndexWriter is open all time. There are two contexts in Tomcat, one to Index
and the other to search and administrative works.
2. The context "search" creates an IndexSearch
3. At the same time arrives a document to be indexed.
4. the context "indexer" uses the IndexWriter to add the document, and it
needs to do a merge and creates and deletes segments.
5. When IndexSearch is goint be used the files are changed, and don�t found
it.

It�s possible?

This seems to contradict an item from the Lucene FAQ:

<<
41. Can I modify the index while performing ongoing searches ?
Yes and no. At the time of writing this FAQ (June 2001), Lucene is not
thread safe in this regard. Here is a quote from Doug Cutting, the creator
of Lucene:


The problems are only when you add documents or optimize an index, and then
search with an IndexReader that was constructed before those changes to the
index were made.
A possible work around is to perform the index updates in a parable and
separate index and switch to the new index when its updating is done. The
switching may be done for example, using a variable that will points to the
directory of the current active index. Since searches have a relatively
short life time, you may discard (or resue the old index) short time after
performing the switch (this grace period should be a little longer if you
want to let all searches that involved paging through the hit list to be
completed with consistent results).
>>

Can you explain further?

I get the error, when I run ant, that it won't build.

why am I building?  when I run the web demo, all the links are formed with
luceneweb/ preceding them (the links are incorrect):

and the links come out as:

http://localhost:8080/luceneweb/examples/foo.jsp

when it should be:

http://localhost:8080/examples/foo.jsp

and I'm using tomcat, btw.

I hunted down the line that gets the path in HTMLDocument (in the demo),
and added some scaffolding to see what it says the link is; and so I wanted
to recompile it (the thought is, that I could do a substring on the path,
if is indeed adding luceneweb/ as part of all the paths). (it's a bit of a
hack, but if it would work....)

anyways, I downloaded javacc and am trying to build, with no avail.  I've
read through the newsgroup archives, read the help files, and looked on the
net...so here I am emailing the group

thanks so much.

some more detail:
ant can't find javacc -  (also, it wants javacc.zip; but the javacc
distrib. I got only comes
with javacc.jar)

from my default.properties file (I added this myself):

# Home directory of JavaCC
javacc.home =   c:/Java tools/javacc-3.1/
javacc.zip.dir = ${javacc.home}/bin/lib
javacc.zip = ${javacc.zip.dir}/javacc.jar

(the above snippet seems to do no good :(

Hi,

> I index my documents, then call writer.optimize and receive

My be the Reason is: WhitespaceTokenizer + a lot of multilanguage texts
with garbage and digits. The example of garbage is: "Lu?y cla ims to.  I
do#'t kn?w abo ut Nlucen e, b ut it sh ould.  An ypor t".

I don't know why but the code with StopAnalyzer work correct.

Hi,

> I index my documents, then call writer.optimize and receive
> this exception. What the reason for it? 

My be the Reason is: WhitespaceTokenizer + a lot of multilanguage texts
with garbage and digits. The example of garbage is: "Lu?y cla ims to.  I
do#'t kn?w abo ut Nlucen e, b ut it sh ould.  An ypor t".

I don't know why but the code with StopAnalyzer work correct.

Pasha

Subject: javacc problem + path/link problem in html demo



I get the error, when I run ant, that it won't build.

why am I building?  when I run the web demo, all the links are formed =
with luceneweb/ preceding them (the links are incorrect):

and the links come out as:

http://localhost:8080/luceneweb/examples/foo.jsp

when it should be:

http://localhost:8080/examples/foo.jsp

and I'm using tomcat, btw.

I hunted down the line that gets the path in HTMLDocument (in the demo), =
and added some scaffolding to see what it says the link is; and so I =
wanted to recompile it (the thought is, that I could do a substring on =
the path, if is indeed adding luceneweb/ as part of all the paths). =
(it's a bit of a hack, but if it would work....)

anyways, I downloaded javacc and am trying to build, with no avail.  =
I've read through the newsgroup archives, read the help files, and =
looked on the net...so here I am emailing the group

thanks so much.

some more detail:
ant can't find javacc -  (also, it wants javacc.zip; but the javacc =
distrib. I got only comes with javacc.jar)

from my default.properties file (I added this myself):

# Home directory of JavaCC
javacc.home =3D   c:/Java tools/javacc-3.1/
javacc.zip.dir =3D ${javacc.home}/bin/lib
javacc.zip =3D ${javacc.zip.dir}/javacc.jar

(the above snippet seems to do no good :(

I saw that bug, but tried it anyways......


but since the bug is still active, do you know where I can an earlier copy

Another Eric, Erik Hatcher is active in both Ant and Lucene (as I found
out in a nofluffjuststuff.com talk) scene.  So hopefully good things
will come about.

Hi Chris!

Yeah, I'll (eventually) have a look at the Lucene build process and see  
if I can fix any issues with JavaCC and such.  No promises on when, but  
soon I hope.

Hello all,

I'm not getting hits for queries that I think should
return hits. 

Description:

I have created index with document having terms "body"
& "title" using StandardAnalyzer. Term "body" is added
to document as Field.Text("body", <text>) and Term
title is added as Field.Keyword("title", <title>). 

I added a document with body have some 300 words and
title with 2 words.

Next, I searched the index with exactly same body that
I indexed and Lucene returns zero hits. I constructed
query using following different ways:

1. QueryParser.parse("body", <body-text>,
StandardAnalyzer);

2. Using PhraseQuery:

TokenStream tokenizer =
StandardAnalyzer.tokenStream(key, new
java.io.StringReader(<body-text>));
Token token;
PhraseQuery pq = new PhraseQuery();
while ((token = tokenizer.next()) != null) 
pq.add(new Term("body", token.termText()));
pq.setSlop(50);

My understanding is that Lucene should return this
document as hit. Please let me know where I'm doing
wrong.

However, search on the title returns correct hit.

Any help on this would be really appreciated.

Thanks,

MP

Hi M P,

Try this:

to index.

doc.add(Field.Text("body", (Reader) new InputStreamReader(is)));

pq.setSlop(50);

My understanding is that Lucene should return this
document as hit. Please let me know where I'm doing
wrong.

However, search on the title returns correct hit.

Any help on this would be really appreciated.

Thanks,

MP

Hi M P,

Try this:

InputStream is = new FileInputStream(filename); where filename is the file
to index.
----
---
---
doc.add(Field.Text("body", (Reader) new InputStreamReader(is)));

Subject: Problem in getting hits

Hello all,

I'm not getting hits for queries that I think should
return hits. 

Description:

I have created index with document having terms "body"
& "title" using StandardAnalyzer. Term "body" is added
to document as Field.Text("body", <text>) and Term
title is added as Field.Keyword("title", <title>). 

I added a document with body have some 300 words and
title with 2 words.

Next, I searched the index with exactly same body that
I indexed and Lucene returns zero hits. I constructed
query using following different ways:

1. QueryParser.parse("body", <body-text>,
StandardAnalyzer);

2. Using PhraseQuery:

TokenStream tokenizer =
StandardAnalyzer.tokenStream(key, new
java.io.StringReader(<body-text>));
Token token;
PhraseQuery pq = new PhraseQuery();
while ((token = tokenizer.next()) != null) 
pq.add(new Term("body", token.termText()));
pq.setSlop(50);

My understanding is that Lucene should return this
document as hit. Please let me know where I'm doing
wrong.

However, search on the title returns correct hit.

Any help on this would be really appreciated.

Thanks,

MP

Hi M P,
Is not StringReader but new InputStreamReader. Try this:

public void indexFile(String filename) throws Exception {
   IndexWriter writer;
   writer = new IndexWriter(path, new SimpleAnalyzer(), false);
   
   InputStream is = new FileInputStream(filename);
   Document doc = new Document();
   doc.add(Field.UndIndexed("path", filename));
   doc.add(Field.Text("body", (Reader) new InputStreamReader(is)));

   writer.addDocument(doc);
   is.close();
   writer.close();
}

Good Luck
Michel

I talked to one of the maintainers of NLucene and he said that he was
planning on releasing a 1.2 version (not beta apparently) in two months.
That was back in June and I haven't heard or seen anything since then so I
cant really say if it is still being actively developed.  Sounds like you
are doing the same thing I am doing which is adding functionality that you
need on your own.  I've also added a few things to NLucene like multifield
queries and the default boolean operator setting.

Hi,

I would really appreciate if anyone could please send
me a sample code on how to query using QueryParser and
PhraseQuery for documents with two fields "title" &
"body" indexed as Field.Keyword & Field.Text
respectively.

Thanks,

Kishore.

By the way, I hope that Lucene.Net 1.3rc1 will be available 
from http://sourceforge.net/ in this week. Lucene.Net is ready, but
sourceforge is not :)

Lucene.Net is a complete up to date port of Lucene 1.3rc1
includes samples and demos (web demo also).

A few differences between nLucene and Lucene.net are:
1. version of Lucene: Lucene.Net is a 1.3rc1, nLucene - is a 1.2
2. java code compatible: Lucene.Net only change naming notation, like
"IndexWriter", nLucene 
implement some methods as a attributes and others
3. demos: Lucene.Net contain all of Lucene demos and tests include web
demos. nLucene does not.
4. .NET Framework 1.1 and VS 2003 compatible
5. (for internal developer only): correct implement of >>> java operator
:)

Hi All,

Recently we came across a problem where Lucene throws too many open files 
problem. We have multiple indexes and each indexes contains over 100 fields. 

After searching the mail list archive I didn't find any usefull information, 
seems like there is a problem with Windows + java regarding on maximum open 
files.

Then I stumbled across this bug (Java bug 4189011)

http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4189011.html

Cut and pasted from the bug record:
" To clarify the issue, on win32 system there are three
ways to open a file:
1: Using Win32 API
2: Using MFC class framework lib.
3: using C-Library API (open() and fopen())

Other than the third option, i.e. option 1 and 2 have practically no
limitation in opening number of files. The third method is restricted
(for the reason not known to me) to open only approx. 2035 files. That
is why MS JVM is able to open unlimited (practically) files, but SUN JVM
fails after 2035 files (my guess is it is using 3rd method to open
file).

 The case is true only only on Win32 OS. The reason this is serious
problem ans we have to revert to MS JVM is because we werr writing high
scalable server in Java. I am sure you understand that Java as an API
must compatible on all platform, some of which are Solaris, NT(Win32),
Novell etc... "

Anyway this guy seems to know what he is talking about (from the bug records 
and all). Anyone else came across the same issue when working with Lucene + 
Windows?

It would be great to see Nlucene continue.  I've been using 1.2b2 and
have a few bug fixes (some critical) which I'd be delighted to
contribute.   Alas, the sourceforge project doesn't show a lot of
vitality of late, but the authors have suggest a new version is coming
RSN...

I know there has been some considerable debate about whether to keep
with the translation to C# or just to re-host the Java Lucene 1.3 using
vs.net's java compiler...

Hi all,

http://sourceforge.net/projects/nlucene/ has a version numbered 1.2b2.
Does anyone know if this source is still being maintained to be closer
to the java developments ? Was this an external project to Apache
Jakarta ?

I (we) have just successfully released a search engine using a c#
implmentation of Lucene.  Code had to be brought up to date in line with
recent java builds, and enhanced with additional features (eg field
sorting, term position score factoring, etc).

Any other c# users who would like to see NLucene kept in line with the
java version ?

Maybe I'm just being lazy with having to maintain my own version of
Lucene =3D). Surely there are others out there who are c# users and =
follow
the mailing lists (I remember a Brian somewhere !) but seldom post.

Yes, given the lack of updating the c# version I thought users would be maintaining their own version in line with current developments.  I too had to add those items you mentioned.

What I would like to see is all these 'implementations' consolidated and maintained regularly as per java.
I am not sure how widely known Lucene is in the .NET community - my guess it it isn't.  A tried and tested Lucene .NET version will definitely help it reach other audiences.

I am pleased to hear Pasha (re)taking up the reigns.

Excellent news.

Will you be keeping the source up to date with the java developments ?
Can't wait to get my hands on the source, yes that damn bit shift operator (unsigned ?) always worried me =)

Just by the way, would the .NET version have a similar style sandbox area where users can submit small add-on type functionality ?
For example, field sorting.
Would love to share the code for use and comment as this seems to be a common request.

Big thanks Pasha,
Brendon

Hi,

Lucene.Net 1.3.rc1 now available from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/lucenedotnet/

Lucene.Net is a complete up to date port of Lucene 1.3.rc1 without
any modifications and extentions of original Lucene code. 

Lucene.Net includes all original Lucene demos and tests, but not all
work correct :)
For example, HTMLTest doesn't work.

when I run the web demo, all the links are formed with
luceneweb/ preceding them (the links are incorrect):

ie-- the links come out as:

http://localhost:8080/luceneweb/examples/foo.jsp

when it should be:

http://localhost:8080/examples/foo.jsp

and I'm using tomcat, btw.

(I sent this earlier along with a javacc question; which people did
answer....but then this part was ignored, so I'm resending it.....since the
above is the problem that I'm really trying to solve)

thanks

solved.

I was building the index incorrectly; the lucene code works just fine.

(you need to go to a subdirectory directly under webapps, and use .. as the
argument for the base of the index, I was using .. and doing it from
webapps (Or from luceneweb ) that's why I got the broken links.  but it
works now :)

when I run the web demo, all the links are formed with
luceneweb/ preceding them (the links are incorrect):

ie-- the links come out as:

http://localhost:8080/luceneweb/examples/foo.jsp

when it should be:

http://localhost:8080/examples/foo.jsp

and I'm using tomcat, btw.

(I sent this earlier along with a javacc question; which people did
answer....but then this part was ignored, so I'm resending it.....since the
above is the problem that I'm really trying to solve)

thanks

Hi everybody,

When I make a search, for example : "Jakarta lucene"

The search engine interpret the query like "Jakarta OR lucene"

I wish this could be "Jakarta AND lucene" (like the most of internet =
search engine) because the OR clause is not very intuitive for the =
users.

Could we use a method for using AND instead OR when we use Lucene?

Tanks for advance

S=E9bastien

I believe what you want is to use the setOperator function:

QueryParser qp = new QueryParser("contents", analyzer);
qp.setOperator(QueryParser.DEFAULT_OPERATOR_AND);

Subject: AND instead OR for the search


Hi everybody,

When I make a search, for example : "Jakarta lucene"

The search engine interpret the query like "Jakarta OR lucene"

I wish this could be "Jakarta AND lucene" (like the most of internet search
engine) because the OR clause is not very intuitive for the users.

Could we use a method for using AND instead OR when we use Lucene?

Tanks for advance

I believe what you want is to use the setOperator function:

QueryParser qp = new QueryParser("contents", analyzer);
qp.setOperator(QueryParser.DEFAULT_OPERATOR_AND);

I tried this before with 1.3rc1. The query parser still uses "OR" rather
than "AND" as default even after I set the operator to AND.
I found this issue had been reported before but no answer for it.

QueryParser, at least in Lucene's CVS, supports an attribute to toggle
this capability.

Hi all and thanks for your precedent help.

I've try the setOperator() method :

First I use this code :
QueryParser qp =3D new QueryParser("content", analyzer);
qp.setOperator(QueryParser.DEFAULT_OPERATOR_AND);
query =3D qp.parse(queryString, "contents", analyzer);

But it does not work (Or is always use in the query).

Then, I look the QueryParser and we could use another parse() method:
That's my second code :
QueryParser qp =3D new QueryParser("content", analyzer);
qp.setOperator(QueryParser.DEFAULT_OPERATOR_AND);
query =3D qp.parse(queryString);

And this work good :-)  (And is now use by default)

Hui : I think this could solve your problem.

Hi,
 
I'm trying to understand the scoring algorithm of lucene. So far as I
understand, it is an implementation of a vector space model with the cosinus
similarity. This model is modified to allow the boost of certain terms. 
 
Is this right or did miss something?
 
Cord

Thank you, Sebastien. It works now.
I think most people are going to do the same thing when they upgrade to 1.3
by leaving the  parse() method from 1.2 there since it is supported in 1.3.

I am having another problem now after I switched to 1.3 from 1.2.  The web
application seach within Jboss 2.4/ Tomcat 3.1 does not work any more. But a
standalone application search works fine on the same index.  The index  was
created on Lucene 1.2.  Here is the exception
[Default] java.lang.NullPointerException
[Default]       at org.apache.lucene.search.Hits.getMoreDocs(Hits.java:90)

Any idea about this?

Thank you, Sebastien. It works now.
I think most people are going to do the same thing when they upgrade to 1.3
by leaving the  parse() method from 1.2 there since it is supported in 1.3.

I am having another problem now after I switched to 1.3 from 1.2.  The web
application seach within Jboss 2.4/ Tomcat 3.1 does not work any more. But a
standalone application search works fine on the same index.  The index  was
created on Lucene 1.2.  Here is the exception
[Default] java.lang.NullPointerException
[Default]       at org.apache.lucene.search.Hits.getMoreDocs(Hits.java:90)

Any idea about this?

Hi all and thanks for your precedent help.

I've try the setOperator() method :

First I use this code :
QueryParser qp = new QueryParser("content", analyzer);
qp.setOperator(QueryParser.DEFAULT_OPERATOR_AND);
query = qp.parse(queryString, "contents", analyzer);

But it does not work (Or is always use in the query).

Then, I look the QueryParser and we could use another parse() method:
That's my second code :
QueryParser qp = new QueryParser("content", analyzer);
qp.setOperator(QueryParser.DEFAULT_OPERATOR_AND);
query = qp.parse(queryString);

And this work good :-)  (And is now use by default)

Hui : I think this could solve your problem.

Hi.

Is it possible to have a similar behaviour in MultiFieldQueryParser?

Thanks, gregor

Thank you, Erik. That is another question I want to ask.
But for this case, it is not the reason. The index created on Lucene 1.2
works fine for the standalone application. I tried calling the same testing
case within a simple jsp and it does not work. I also built an small index
within Lucene 1.3 API, the problem remains. Checked the source codes, it
seems the Searcher implementation does not pass it's reference sucessfully
to the Hits.

Regards,
Hui

You should re-index using 1.3 when you upgrade the library to 1.3.  I
don't know the differences specifically (without doing some CVS diffs)
but there were some changes that affect the index format.

so, I pasted in the code given in an earlier email:

QueryParser qp = new QueryParser("content", analyzer);
qp.setOperator(QueryParser.DEFAULT_OPERATOR_AND);
query = qp.parse(queryString);


it compiles, but it can't find anything.

when I comment that out and put in the vanilla call to parse, then it works
fine (but with "OR") functionality.

I'm thinking the current fix (although cludgy)
is to prepend each word in the query with a +

what am I doing wrong?  or is this a bug?
(I looked in bugzilla and couldn't find anything)

thanks in advance

Hello all --

I am having trouble building Lucene. I have downloaded and extracted the
following:

lucene-1.2-src.tar.gz
apache-ant-1.5.3-1-bin.tar.bz2

I have followed the Ant installation as per the docs, so JAVA_HOME and
ANT_HOME are set, and the $ANT_HOME$/bin directory is in the path. I am
running Slackware Linux.

When running "ant" while in the lucene base directory I get an error
message about JavaCC not being installed. I downloaded javacc-3.1, and the
error message reports back the way I have set it up:
  [echo] JavaCC Home: /home/ga11/javacc-3.1
  [echo] JavaCC Zip: /home/ga11/javacc-3.1.zip
However I am also asked to downloade JavaCC 2.0, and the build process
aborts:
  [echo] Please download and install JavaCC 2.0 from:

The problem is that I cannot find JavaCC 2.0 for download anywhere. Either
I need v2.0 for the build to succeed, or I am not using/specifying v3.1
properly. Any help would be much appreciated.

cheers,
Gerret

Hello all --

I am having trouble building Lucene. I have downloaded and extracted the
following:

lucene-1.2-src.tar.gz
apache-ant-1.5.3-1-bin.tar.bz2

I have followed the Ant installation as per the docs, so JAVA_HOME and
ANT_HOME are set, and the $ANT_HOME$/bin directory is in the path. I am
running Slackware Linux.

When running "ant" while in the lucene base directory I get an error
message about JavaCC not being installed. I downloaded javacc-3.1, and the
error message reports back the way I have set it up:
  [echo] JavaCC Home: /home/ga11/javacc-3.1
  [echo] JavaCC Zip: /home/ga11/javacc-3.1.zip
However I am also asked to downloade JavaCC 2.0, and the build process
aborts:
  [echo] Please download and install JavaCC 2.0 from:

The problem is that I cannot find JavaCC 2.0 for download anywhere. Either
I need v2.0 for the build to succeed, or I am not using/specifying v3.1
properly. Any help would be much appreciated.

cheers,
Gerret

Hi

Having distributed this to several folks on the list over the past few
months, I've put a copy of the .zip file up for general download.

http://anklebiter.net/tech/JavaCC2_1.zip

Thanks to the people from the JavaCC users list for sending it to me!

Is there a plan to move to the latest version of the JavaCC (3)?

Enjoy!

brian

Hi,

When I do a search, I obtain the hits I expected, but I get many other
hits that I think is the result of the scoring algorithm. Do you know if
there is a way to obtain only the exact terms searched ?

Thanks,

MHF

Hi,
Found the problem for this. I need to switch to JDK1.3.1 or above (jdk1.4)
to make Lucene 1.3 works. It just does not work with jdk 1.3.0

Just for information, I've try a lot of jdk to benchmark performances (just
in a red hat 7.3 linux server)
Then, The result reveals that with Lucene the 1.4 JVM from IBM is 3 to 4
time more faster than with the SUN 1.4 JVM (but just for the search because
it semms that IBM VM is not very stable and less speed for other Java
applications like IO programming)

I think so IBM VM is maybe better to work with Lucene in standalone
application.

In my case, I use IBM VM for the lucene search (more speed) and Sun VM for
Tomcat (more stable)

Thanks for finding the file Brian! I'm still having trouble with the build
however :/

I've downloaded JavaCC2_1.zip and updated relevant build.properties
entries like this:

javacc.home = /home/ga11/cs517/indexing/lucene-1.2-src
javacc.zip.dir = ${javacc.home}/lib
javacc.zip = ${javacc.zip.dir}/JavaCC2_1.zip

and made sure there are no typos in the pathnames.

However I get the same error message as before: javacc_check fails and I
am prompted to download version 2.0. I'm using jdk1.4.2 on slackware
linux. Do you know what may be the problem?

cheers,
Gerret

did you unzip and install JavaCC correctly?  when you install it, it
contains a .zip file of the JavaCC classes (rather than a .jar file), so
once installed, you can reset your build properties to reflect the
location of _that_ .zip file.

did you unzip and install JavaCC correctly?  when you install it, it
contains a .zip file of the JavaCC classes (rather than a .jar file), so
once installed, you can reset your build properties to reflect the
location of _that_ .zip file.

Hi all,

	We have sandboxed file system which Lucene indexes.  Periodically we dump
the file system to disk (checkpoint it); can a Lucene index be checkpointed
then restored and used?  Currently we simply rebuild the index since it only
takes a few minutes.  But we would like the user to be able to take a
snapshot of that file system and restore and use it without rebuilding the
index.

	Let me know.

Thanks,

Rob

As long as you finish any index operations when you checkpoint it, 
there should be any problems.  A Lucene index is just regular ol' 
filesystem files just like everything else, so there is no problem 
storing it off and using it later.

Hi,

Does lucene (any version) support native hit highlighting? If so, how? I 
searced the mailing lists and didnt come up with anything definitive.

Thanks

No.  There is some code in the contributions section of the lucene site that
does highlighting (http://www.iq-computing.de/).   However, its pretty
inefficient as it scans the entire document looking for each word and then
highlights it (which is the part you have to code yourself).  I think using
IndexReader.termPositions()  to seek to the location of the terms would be a
better way to do things.  In either case, I guess the long answer to your
question is no, there is no native support for term highlighting (or context
retreival).  You'll have to write at least some code if you want to do that.
I'll be working on that very shortly for the project I'm on right now, but
I'm using the C# port of Lucene so the code will have to be changed to work
with the regular Java version (although only slightly I'm guessing).

Lucene doesn't support native hit highlighting, but look at this web
site:

Highlighting search results with Lucene 1.3
http://home.clara.net/markharwood/lucene/highlight.htm=20

I don't use it because I'm still with version 1.2, but I plan to give
it a try as soon as I upgrade
Lucene for our applications.

Hope this helps.
Adriano

The Highlighting search results works with Lucene1.2 final released(the

I want to run a query where all the results would have the identical 
score of 1.0 (all documents of type X with a date > D)

The trick is that i need to get the result set BACK sorted by the date.  
The Lucene filter mechanism is optimized to use the index but the only 
problem is that I want to get the results back by date. 

It appears that Lucene will return the result set back by date but I 
assume that since the scores are identical it isn't doing a sort by 
score so I am getting my results back in descending order.  Would this 
be a correct assumption?  Is this behavior something I can depend on?

Thanks!

Kevin

I want to run a query where all the results would have the identical 
score of 1.0 (all documents of type X with a date > D)

The trick is that i need to get the result set BACK sorted by the date.  
The Lucene filter mechanism is optimized to use the index but the only 
problem is that I want to get the results back by date. 

It appears that Lucene will return the result set back by date but I 
assume that since the scores are identical it isn't doing a sort by 
score so I am getting my results back in descending order.  Would this 
be a correct assumption?  Is this behavior something I can depend on?

Thanks!

Kevin

Hi,
When I give a search query like title:(\\) QueryParser throws an error. But
same query given without any braces i.e title:\\ works fine.
Why is it so ?

thanks for your help,

Hi,

im currently trying to understand how the standard query parser
handles operator precedence in a query like
a OR b AND c OR d
This is output by the toString method as
a +b +c d
so AND seems to have higher precedence than OR

Now if I try to check this and look at
a OR ( b AND c ) OR d
I see
a (+b +c) d
which is still fine so far, but I get a different search result.

a OR b AND C OR d matches one document that contains two tokens 'c'
one token 'b' and three tokens 'd'.
a OR (b AND c) OR d matches this document plus another one, that 
contains one 'a', a number of 'b', no 'c' and no 'd'.
Token number found looking at the tokens in my input. So I might
have overseen some difference between my indexing and my token
counting.

But the question I don't understand is:
What is the difference between
a OR b AND c OR d
and 
a OR ( b AND c ) OR d
or
a +b +c d
and
a (+b +c) d
Why do I get different results?

Back to my original question of operator precedence:
b AND c
gives one hit.
But
b AND c OR a AND d
(output as  +b +c +a +d)
gives none.
So my theory of AND having higher precedence than OR does not hold.

Of course I should try to understand this rather from the sources than
from some experiments.
I tried, but I didn't succed.

So can anyone help me with the question how queries containing 
AND OR and NOT are executed if one does not explicitly use 
parentheses?

greetings
	Morus

I have been giving some thought to using Lucene as an RDF database.   
I'm specifically thinking about the RDF model and not the RDF syntax.

Essentially this would just comprise triples encoded in a document as 
fields.

So for example we would have subject predicate and object relationships 
as document fields.  Subject and predicates would be Tokens and then the 
object field would be indexed.

For example a triple (document) would be:

    http://jakarta.apache.org -> title -> "A great Java developer's website"

This would be just one document in the index.

This would have a lot of advantages most importantly speed and the 
reliability of Lucene and the ability to run a full text query on objects.

For example we could query on "Java" and get back 
"http://jakarta.apache.org"

The major downside I could see is that this would mean that we would be 
indexing a LOT of small documents with a LOT of index updates.

Can anyone see any problems here?  This database will eventually grow to 
around 2TB in the next month so performance issues are non-trivial.

Most people have deployed Lucene with large document sizes and the fact 
that most people are citing document COUNT makes me nervous.

Kevin

I have been giving some thought to using Lucene as an RDF database.   
I'm specifically thinking about the RDF model and not the RDF syntax.

Essentially this would just comprise triples encoded in a document as 
fields.

So for example we would have subject predicate and object relationships 
as document fields.  Subject and predicates would be Tokens and then the 
object field would be indexed.

For example a triple (document) would be:

    http://jakarta.apache.org -> title -> "A great Java developer's website"

This would be just one document in the index.

This would have a lot of advantages most importantly speed and the 
reliability of Lucene and the ability to run a full text query on objects.

For example we could query on "Java" and get back 
"http://jakarta.apache.org"

The major downside I could see is that this would mean that we would be 
indexing a LOT of small documents with a LOT of index updates.

Can anyone see any problems here?  This database will eventually grow to 
around 2TB in the next month so performance issues are non-trivial.

Most people have deployed Lucene with large document sizes and the fact 
that most people are citing document COUNT makes me nervous.

We have something like 20 million statements per gigabyte (RDF/XML).
Even if what you store into the index is more compact (let's say 2
million statements per gigabyte), with terrabytes of data you might
eventually run out of document identifiers (positive integers).


I have previously done some tests with storing RDF into a relational
database. Following is a list of fields I used; I believe the same
should work for a Lucene index.

  model_ns
  model
  statement_ns
  statement
  subject_ns
  subject
  predicate_ns
  predicate
  resource_ns
  resource
  literal

model_ns/model is used to create logical groups of statements. Either
resource_ns/resource or literal is used to store the object of the
statement. Latter can only be queried properly when using a database
that supports large text fields such as MySQL or PostreSQL; obviously
not an issue for Lucene.

Why was an int chosen to represent document handles?  Is there a reason 
for this?  Why wasn't a long chosen to represent document handles?  64 
bits seems like the obvious choice here except for a potentially bloated 
datastore.... (32 extra bits)

I guess one possible solution is to use multiple indexes.  This way you 
could run the search on each index and build a 64bit handle with the 
first 32bits being the index handle and the second 32bits being the 
local handle.

Hi Kevin,

your idea could work for higher mega-byte ranges, I guess, don't know how
about several TBytes.

We have been considering a concept to use Lucene as an RDF backend for a
semantic search engine, because of its reported excellent scalability, on
the order of tens of Megs. The idea was similar to yours and but we thought
of using some index extension to introduce the class / properties hierarchy
(i.e., RDF Schema) and make them searchable via cascaded index lookups.

Didn't have the time, though, to test it, but would be grateful if you could
comment.

Here are the fields, in a draft with three index parts it's something like:

node (unique)
clss (class in schema)
prop (position-ordered)
prwt (a scalar value, weighting the relation or 1, position-ordered)
rsrc (resource, position-ordered)

and for the ontology itself:

clss
spcl (superclass, multi-inheritance)

and

prop (property)
sprp (super-property, multi-inheritance)
domn (domain)
rnge (range)

Best regards,

gregor

We have been considering a concept to use Lucene as an RDF backend for a
semantic search engine, because of its reported excellent scalability, on
the order of tens of Megs. The idea was similar to yours and but we thought
of using some index extension to introduce the class / properties hierarchy
(i.e., RDF Schema) and make them searchable via cascaded index lookups.

Didn't have the time, though, to test it, but would be grateful if you could
comment.

Here are the fields, in a draft with three index parts it's something like:

node (unique)
clss (class in schema)
prop (position-ordered)
prwt (a scalar value, weighting the relation or 1, position-ordered)
rsrc (resource, position-ordered)

and for the ontology itself:

clss
spcl (superclass, multi-inheritance)

and

prop (property)
sprp (super-property, multi-inheritance)
domn (domain)
rnge (range)

Best regards,

gregor

Subject: Lucene as a high-performance RDF database.


I have been giving some thought to using Lucene as an RDF database.
I'm specifically thinking about the RDF model and not the RDF syntax.

Essentially this would just comprise triples encoded in a document as
fields.

So for example we would have subject predicate and object relationships
as document fields.  Subject and predicates would be Tokens and then the
object field would be indexed.

For example a triple (document) would be:

    http://jakarta.apache.org -> title -> "A great Java developer's website"

This would be just one document in the index.

This would have a lot of advantages most importantly speed and the
reliability of Lucene and the ability to run a full text query on objects.

For example we could query on "Java" and get back
"http://jakarta.apache.org"

The major downside I could see is that this would mean that we would be
indexing a LOT of small documents with a LOT of index updates.

Can anyone see any problems here?  This database will eventually grow to
around 2TB in the next month so performance issues are non-trivial.

Most people have deployed Lucene with large document sizes and the fact
that most people are citing document COUNT makes me nervous.

Kevin

Dear Lucene Users,

I'm glad to announce that a new version of Luke is available for 
download, and as a Java WebStart application.

Luke is a diagnostic tool for Lucene (http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene) 
indexes. It enables you to browse documents in existing indexes, perform 
queries, navigate through terms, optimize indexes and more.

Please go to http://www.getopt.org/luke and give it a try. You can 
either use the Java WebStart version, or just download the JAR file with 
binaries. Full source code is available, under Apache license.

Changes in v0.2:

* Add Java WebStart version.
* Add Read-Only mode.
* Fix spinbox bug (really a bug in the Thinlet toolkit - fixed there).
* Allow to browse hidden directories.
* Add a combobox to choose the default field for searching.
* Other minor code cleanups.

Thanks to all who provided their comments and suggestions!

I can't speak for actual reasons (not being core Lucene developer), but the
general benefits of 32-bit ints vs. longs are:

- Better performance on pretty much any current architecture (even so-called
  64-bit CPUs often prefer 32-bit data access, and 64-bit representations are
  more important for addressing).
  Also, smaller data set size is usually also good for performance (caching).
- Atomicity of access (read access can often be done without synchronizing);
  longs can not be atomically accessed in Java.

Another question is whether limited address space presents a real problem. 
Since Lucene can reuse doc ids (or rather, there is not persistent id per se? 
doc id is just an index, and holes left by removed docs can be reused?), 
perhaps this is usually not much of an issue?

I am attempting to create approx 10 different Lucene indexes.  I'm trying to
create them at the same time by running multiple processes and each index is
written to a new directory.  Once I create more than one process - the
performance is very, very slow.  

Any sample code out there showing an efficient way to create multiple
indexes?

Also, Any sample code out there to search the multiple indexes?

thanks, 
Tom

I can't speak for actual reasons (not being core Lucene developer), but the
general benefits of 32-bit ints vs. longs are:

- Better performance on pretty much any current architecture (even so-called
  64-bit CPUs often prefer 32-bit data access, and 64-bit representations
are
  more important for addressing).
  Also, smaller data set size is usually also good for performance
(caching).
- Atomicity of access (read access can often be done without synchronizing);
  longs can not be atomically accessed in Java.

Another question is whether limited address space presents a real problem. 
Since Lucene can reuse doc ids (or rather, there is not persistent id per
se? 
doc id is just an index, and holes left by removed docs can be reused?), 
perhaps this is usually not much of an issue?

You didn't provide details about your setup, but my first guess is that
all your processes are writing the indices on the same disk, and that
disk is your bottleneck.

Hi,

nice Tool.

Here some points for further developments:
show the contents of a Reader-valued Field
open the original Dokuments with the platform dependant mimetype viewer

But Reader-valued fields are not "stored" in the index=20
(Field.Text(name, Reader), that is).  The only thing it could show is=20
the terms from that field for each document.

I pronounce it "lieu'-seen" or "loo'-seen", usually the latter because I'm
lazy.

Hello,

Thanks to Andrzej for this new version! Luke is really useful.

> open the original Dokuments with the platform dependant mimetype viewer
???

My suggestions by order of importance would be :

- History of the 5 last indexes used : under the File Menu item ?
- Remove the empty field (see mailing list Lucene dev 4/16/2003 message from
Otis)
- Possibility to merge different indexes
- Information about the # of segments
[- and almost impossible : recompose the unstored fields of a document]

Best regards

Julien

Yes, all the indices were being written to the same disk.  The box has 3
disks (75GB, 37GB, 110GB)  would I be better off creating them across all
three?  If so, would I then move them all to the same disk to search
against?

You didn't provide details about your setup, but my first guess is that
all your processes are writing the indices on the same disk, and that
disk is your bottleneck.

Someone else already explained the problems with this... What is a 
document in Lucene? It's a set of fields and their String values (or 
their terms), so it's not possible to open the original document from 
which the values were extracted, because there is no original...

No problem. I mean, technically it's no problem, it's just a problem of 
getting to it on my so called "free time" ...

Well... I thought it was just reported as a bug. I don't see any 
responses to this, so I guess this is still a bug, and Luke is not the 
one to be fixed. :-)

Need to check this, but shouldn't be any problem. I'm not sure whether 
it's useful, though... ?

It's not impossible, just time-consuming - all information (except the 
parts removed by analyzer) is already there. This functionality has a 
high "cool-ness" factor, which makes it very tempting... :-)

Thanks for these suggestions! I can't promise any timeline, but 
eventually I'd like to include this functionality in Luke. Patches are 
always welcome... :-)

We store the paths to the documents in the index, partly for exactly 
this reason, partly to get an identifier for the documents. The thing I 
could see Luke doing would be guessing that a field contains a path or 
URL and then offering to give it to BrowserLauncher, which you use anyway.

Personally I'd like to see this feature, too. It would be interesting to 
analyse an index by looking at unusual terms and then being able to see 
the full document somewhere. But I think it is hard to generalize the 
approach and it might actually break for our indexes sooner or later 
since we are thinking about storing the location relative to the indexed 
directories -- which allows us to use one index with different file 
system mappings, e.g. to index a directory locally on a Linux box which 
is then used on a Windows client via SMB. If we go down this road the 
index wouldn't contain the complete information for opening files anymore.

Just my 2c,
   Peter

As Otis said: disk access probably creates the trouble, since your 
disk's head has to be at 20 positions at once (10 indexes, 10 input 
directories). At that is assuming not too much fragmentation.

Creating them on different disks and moving them across is not a problem 
as long as you don't put any relative paths in the index yourself. 
Creating them sequentially instead of parallel might be another option 
to speed up things.

We actually do both -- ignoring the fact that parallel might be slower 
on a single disk since we don't really know which disks are involved. 
Our program is a little GUI application running the indexing in the 
background (see http://tockit.sf.net/docco). You can find our code here:

  http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/toscanaj/docco/

or to be more specific:

  
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/toscanaj/docco/source/org/tockit/docco/

The bits you ask for are in the "index", "indexer" and "query" packages. 
"documenthandler" might also be interesting since it contains code to 
read text, html, xml and OpenOffice documents. There are also plugins 
for POI, PDFbox and Multivalent here:

  http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/toscanaj/docco/plugins/

The code can be checked out via anonymous cvs as usual with Sourceforge:

If they are IDE disks you should NOT try to build multiple indexes at 
once since your disks will bottleneck.

If you are using SCSI/Fibre disks you should be able to write out 
multiple indexes at once but you should benchmark it to make sure that 
it is in fact faster.

It is a downloadable application, so I don't know what the disks are ;-) 
I guess a common scenario is that someone indexes local and network 
directories. Then the parallel execution probably doesn't hurt, it might 
actually help. Of course it would be smarter to index server-side, but 
that is not yet implemented.

For the little application we wrote the indexing speed doesn't seem too 
important anyway. And it allows updating the index which means that 
benchmarking is harder -- although it probably also means that accessing 
multiple locations on the same drive hurts more, since the CPU is most 
likely used less in comparison to the disks if a document is up-to-date. 
But I can live with it, so I rather keep it for now. Maybe one day we 
change from the threaded model we have now to a queued model, but I am 
not sure if our users would be happy with it, since it means they either 
have to wait for the just requested update until everything else is 
finished, or we would have to add controls for the processing order, 
which bloats the UI.

I don't see this documented anywhere and before I start ripping apart 
Lucene I wanted to find out if anyone has done this before.

I want to provide my own scoring of Lucene results based on my own score 
algorithm.  It isn't JUST based on word frequency but also a lot of 
other metrics (think PageRank).

The problem is that i think I am going to have to do this with my own 
subqueries or integrating directly into IndexSearcher while doing my own 
scoring.  Hits.doc() is expensive to say the least (I am assuming it 
fetches all fields?) and it doesn't seem that there is a straight 
forward way to add a visitor that will be called to develop my own 
custom score.

Anyone have any advice here?

Kevin

Sure - I meant HIDE this field in the summary as a temporary solution
but it would be better to solve the problem in Lucene of course.

It 's an indication of whether or not an index has to be optimized.

Hi,
I just upgrade Lucene 1.2 to 1.3 on the same index built original from =
Lucene 1.2 and then latter from Lucene 1.3.
I also changed the default operator to AND.
It seems work fine but  actually the search results from Lucene 1.3 are =
not as good as the results from 1.2 (same index and same query) even the =
query
  a..  top documents from 1.3 are not as good as the ones from 1.2
  b.. the top document score from 1.3 are almost the same and 1.2 has =
better score system.
Any idea about this? Is there any way I can achieve the same search =
quality within 1.3?=20

=20

Regards,
Hui Ouyang

I had a look at the current Lucene API, and I realized that this is a 
very costly operation now. Now, if we had a TermVector support that was 
mentioned several times on this list, things would be very different...

Does anyone know what is the status / plans regarding this?

Hi All,

Is there a maximum field size in Lucene? I found that by having a really big 
String as a field in a document, I couldn't search the tokens that exist in 
the end of the document.

I'm stumped, I've never read anywhere in the documentation that there is such 
limit in Field. Am I the only one having the problem here?

Victor Hadianto

Hi All,

Why can't we use Reader to index stored value in Lucene. I found it strange. 
And also in the code I saw that the String value is converted to a 
StringReader anyway.

Any reason why?

I saw a post that sort of touched on my question, I think, but it didn't
seem quite the same...

What's the best way to index a document with multiple values for the same
field?  I'm trying to optimize search time and accuracy.

We have a database of companies that we want to be able to search on, and
the fields will include company name, address, and telephone number.  Some
companies have more than one name, though.  For example, BMG is also known
as Bertelsmann Music Group.  Our users need to be able to search on either
of these names and find a match.  In our raw data, these different names are
in separate fields for alternate names...  But which is a better way to
implement this in Lucene:

A) Duplicate documents by using all the same data except for the name (i.e.
1 document for BMG at 123 fake street and 1 document for Bertelsmann Music
Group at 123 fake street)

B) Create 5 fields for alternate names (Which 80% of companies don't have at
all so they'd be empty) and then when doing a search query, search for the
same thing across all 6 fields?  (i.e. name:BMG OR altname1:BGM OR
altname2:BMG... etc)

C) Put all of the altername names together into the name field (i.e. BMG
Bertelsmann Music Group).  Is there anything to delimit the different names
with so that they would be treated as separate entities?

This is what I would do. If you are not going to have large value in this 
field, and you don't need it for later display (ie for UnStored field) then 
put all the variant name in the "Name" field. This will be the easiest to do 
and you don't have to "or"s a lot of field (or use multi field query) later.

Also you can do: 
doc.add(Field.UnStored("Name", "BMG"));
doc.add(Field.UnStored("Name", "Berstelsmann Music Group"));

and that will be the same with:
doc.add(Field.UnStored("Name", "BMG Berstelsmann Music Group"));

This is what I would do. If you are not going to have large value in this 
field, and you don't need it for later display (ie for UnStored field) then 
put all the variant name in the "Name" field. This will be the easiest to do 
and you don't have to "or"s a lot of field (or use multi field query) later.

Also you can do: 
doc.add(Field.UnStored("Name", "BMG"));
doc.add(Field.UnStored("Name", "Berstelsmann Music Group"));

and that will be the same with:
doc.add(Field.UnStored("Name", "BMG Berstelsmann Music Group"));

Hi,

I've finally found the solution. Instead of using build.properties, I
changed the javacc.home in default.properties file. Not sure why when using
build.properties it didn't work.

Thanks.

I would like to ask of what algorithm or statistics that Hits.score() method is using?
Is it bayesian?

I have changed the scoring method of my own lucene-based system. I made use of the Similarity class to create my own Similarity class. I also change some classes like TermQuery class in order to implement my own scoring.

I hope my experience can help you, Kevin.

Hello,
     I have a requirement for a web crawler which should
recursively search a given URL for a set of search keywords.
e.g.. I would like to search http://cnn.com for any news on
Formula-One that happened today.

I would like to know the following,
1> Can i use LARM with Lucene for this.
2> Where can i get a copy of LARM jar file.

Any help is appreciated,

Thanks,
Jagadesh.

I can think of three options:

1) Single index dir on a shared drive (NFS, etc.) which is mounted on =
each
app server.=20

2) Create copies of the index dir for each machine. Requires regular
updates, etc (not good if search data changes often).

3) Create a web service for search. Each app server makes an HTTP call =
to a
standalone Lucene app which returns some sort of XML-formatted search
result.=20

I've taken approaches 1 and 3 (w/ Verity, but it would likely be the =
same w/
Lucene). 2 is really only good if you have relatively static data. For =
our
Lucene rollout here, we're going w/ option 1.

Subject: Make Lucene Index distributable

Hallo All,
We have developed our WebApp with Lucene under Tomcat 4.X and stored =

Cluster. My Problem is to create a distributable Index of Lucene. Have =

I can think of three options:

1) Single index dir on a shared drive (NFS, etc.) which is mounted on =
each
app server.=20

2) Create copies of the index dir for each machine. Requires regular
updates, etc (not good if search data changes often).

3) Create a web service for search. Each app server makes an HTTP call =
to a
standalone Lucene app which returns some sort of XML-formatted search

I've taken approaches 1 and 3 (w/ Verity, but it would likely be the =
same w/
Lucene). 2 is really only good if you have relatively static data. For =
our
Lucene rollout here, we're going w/ option 1.

Hi,

after working with lucene again after nearly two years of
abstinence, yeah ;-), I'm running into trouble :-/

Hope I didn't miss it in the FAQs: IndexReader.termDocs(Term)
doesn't return a positioned TermDocs with lucene 1.3 RC1
(actually it seems to return the same as a termDocs() call).
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe the RC1 ?

Cheers,
Frank

Thanks Andrew,
I will check 1) approach and ask Administration of the Bea platform for =
a
shared drive.
3) not really solve this Problem just move the Web Service Application,
because the same platform. Firstly I wanted to store Index in the
Oracle-Database use DBDirectory, but we don't have enough time for
implementation and test.=20

Is it possible without extensive additional coding to use Lucene to =
conduct a search based on a document rather than a query?  (One use of =
this would be to refine a search by selecting one of the hits returned =
from the initial query and subsequently retrieving other documents =
"like" the selected one.)

Using the QueryFilter would help with the refining a search based on 
hits from a previous search, but it wouldn't help with the "like" part 
your asked about.

I'm interested in what you turn up with this though.

 You may need to rebuild the index with 1.3. Buried in the Changes document
it says that you have to rebuild the index with 1.3, because the scoring was
changed internally.

Hi,
I just upgrade Lucene 1.2 to 1.3 on the same index built original from
Lucene 1.2 and then latter from Lucene 1.3.
I also changed the default operator to AND.
It seems work fine but  actually the search results from Lucene 1.3 are not
as good as the results from 1.2 (same index and same query) even the query
  a..  top documents from 1.3 are not as good as the ones from 1.2
  b.. the top document score from 1.3 are almost the same and 1.2 has better
score system.
Any idea about this? Is there any way I can achieve the same search quality
within 1.3?

Be careful with option 1.  NFS and the Lucene file-based locking 
mechanism don't get along extremely well.  (See the archives for details...)

Be careful with option 1.  NFS and the Lucene file-based locking 
mechanism don't get along extremely well.  (See the archives for details...)

We have the Lucene index sitting out on a Linux server and wrote a little
daemon that listens for requests and sends back response objects.  We are a
large scale simulation outfit and it works great.  We also give the node the
ability to index locally.

I published a paper all about it that will be presented at SIW this year.

Thanks,

Rob

Hi Terry,

we have been thinking about the same problem and in the end we decided 
that most likely the only good solution to this is to keep a 
non-inverted index, i.e. a map from the documents to the terms. Then you 
can query the most terms for the documents and query other documents 
matching parts of this (where you get the usual question of what is 
actually interesting: high frequency, low frequency or the mid range).

Indexing would probably be quite expensive since Lucene doesn't seem to 
support changes in the index, and the index for the terms would change 
all the time. We haven't implemented it yet, but it shouldn't be hard to 
code. I just wouldn't expect good performance when indexing large 
collections.

  Peter

Hi Peter,

What got me thinking about this was the way that Lucene computes similarity
(or scoring).  After the boolean keyword matches have been found, Lucene
then computes relevance.  What Lucene does, I think, is to process the query
into some intermediate internal representation and computes the similarity
between the query (now a kind of a pseudo-document) and each of the matching
hits.

I was wondering if there might not be a way to internally process a selected
document (rather than the query per se) and then, in effect, compute the
similarity between that document and all the other documents (which have
already been pre-processed in the indexing process).  So, what you'd be
doing is not a boolean keyword match, but a ranking of all the documents in
the repository on the basis of relevance or similarity to the target
document.

(If that's not too far off in terms of reality, maybe Doug could comment?)

Regards,

Terry

Hi Peter

If the original document is available. You could extract keywords from 
the document
at query time. That is when someone asks for documents similar to 
document a. You
re-analyze document a and in combination with statistics from the Lucene 
index you extract
keywords from document a that can then be used as a query for findining 
similar documents.

I've got some sample code if anyone is interested.

Hi Magnus,

thanks for the offer, but unfortunately I can't/don't want to make the 
assumption that I can easily access the documents to re-index them. And 
I don't think this approach would be feasible unless you can keep the 
documents in memory somehow.

Storing the other/non-inverted/normal/whatever index would be expensive 
for indexing, but querying should be a lot faster than having to 
re-index documents. That is in our situation preferable.

  Peter

Hi Magnus,

thanks for the offer, but unfortunately I can't/don't want to make the 
assumption that I can easily access the documents to re-index them. And 
I don't think this approach would be feasible unless you can keep the 
documents in memory somehow.

Storing the other/non-inverted/normal/whatever index would be expensive 
for indexing, but querying should be a lot faster than having to 
re-index documents. That is in our situation preferable.

  Peter

Hi Peter,

I guess you are right.

I've implemented this for a index with ten millions of really small
documents that all are stored in the index. The documents are never more 
than a thousand
words so re-indexing is quick enough. However it is probably not 
advisable to do
this with bigger documents or documents that need additional parsing.

Hello,

I developed an Client-Server application on the web, with a search  
module using Lucene. In the same application, the users can index new  
text.

So, multiple sessions can acces to the Index and concurrences problems  
can be possible.

I used Threads in Java. Is it the best solutions?

I call :

IndexFiles indexFiles = new IndexFiles();
indexFiles.run();

Here you are an extract of my code.

Thanks.

public class IndexFiles extends Thread{
     public IndexFiles(){
     }

     public void run(){
              
SynchronizedIndexWriter.insertDocument(currentIndexDocument(),"tmp/ 
IndexPath",new MainAnalyser());
     }

}



public class SynchronizedIndexWriter {

     static synchronized  void insertDocument(IndexDocument  
document,String indexLocValue,Analyzer analyzerValue){
         File f=new File(indexLocValue);
         if (f.exists())  
addDocumentToIndex(document,indexLocValue,analyzerValue,false);
         else  
addDocumentToIndex(document,indexLocValue,analyzerValue,true);
     }


     static  synchronized void addDocumentToIndex(IndexDocument  
document,String indexLocValue,Analyzer analyzerValue,boolean  
createNewIndex){
         try{
             IndexWriter indexWriter = new  
IndexWriter(indexLocValue,analyzerValue,createNewIndex);
             indexWriter.addDocument(document.getDocument());
             indexWriter.optimize();
             indexWriter.close();
         }
         catch(IOException io){
	    // If IndexWrite don't know write on index because it's locked,  
recall of the function
               => It's not very safe
              
addDocumentToIndex(document,indexLocValue,analyzerValue,createNewIndex);
         }
         catch(Exception e){

         }

     }
}

My index grew about 7 gigs larger than I projected it would, and it ran out
of disk space during optimize.  Does lucene have transactions or anything
that would prevent this from corrupting an index, or do I need to generate
the index again?

Thanks!

Why do you have concurency problems? are you trying to
have each user initiate the indexing himself? because
that will create issues, how about you put all the new
files you want to index in a directory and then have a
schedule procedure on the webserver run the lucene
indexer on that directory, our application hasn't had
any concurrency problems at all, because we index based
on a pull system, rather than the user puching
documents to the indexer.

I hope I understood your problem correctly, so that the
answer is useful

Yes.  You can (and should for best performance) reuse an IndexSearcher 
as long as you don't need access to changes made to the index.  An open 
IndexSearcher won't pick up changes to the index, so if you need to see 
the changes, you will need to open a new searcher at that point.

Hi.  I'm using lucene 1.2 on a linux 2.4.18 kernel and I just did a quick
profile of lucene using runhprof under jdk1.3.1, and found that nearly 25%
of the cpu time was going towards an exception that I didn't even know
existed.  Lucene appears to be swallowing whatever it is because I'm not
seeing it thrown to my code.

What's going on?

Thanks!

Hi all!

I am working with Lucene 1.3 RC1 and found what I think is a problem.
Basically, I am indexing into a RAMDirectory and then using addIndexes to
merge the RAMDirectory into a file system index.  Adding in a small
number of documents doesn't seem to work.

My test code is like this:

		Directory memDir = new RAMDirectory();

		File tempDir = new File(System.getProperty("user.dir"), "test2");
		Directory fsDir = FSDirectory.getDirectory(tempDir, true);

		IndexWriter fsWriter =
			new IndexWriter(fsDir, new StandardAnalyzer(), true);

		IndexWriter memWriter =
			new IndexWriter(memDir, new StandardAnalyzer(), true);

		Document toAdd1 = createADocument(); // creates a random document
		Document toAdd2 = createADocument();

		memWriter.addDocument(toAdd1);
		memWriter.addDocument(toAdd2);

	      String[] files = memDir.list();
	      for(int i=0;i<1;i++){
              System.out.println(files[i]); // Only lists "segments" file,
no data files
            }

		fsWriter.addIndexes(new Directory[] { memDir });

		fsWriter.close();

		IndexReader reader =
			IndexReader.open(FSDirectory.getDirectory(tempDir, false));

            Document toCompare = reader.document(1); // Results in
ArrayIndexOutofBoundsException

		reader.close();
		tempDir.delete();

I should be able to get the document at index 1, but it fails.  If I add in
12 documents by doing this:

memWriter.addDocument(toAdd1);
memWriter.addDocument(toAdd2);

for(int i=0;i<10;i++){
	memWriter.addDocument(createADocument());
}

I only see 10 documents returned by IndexReader.termDocs(Term) on the
FSDirectory after I merge the RAMDirectory in.  Any insights on why this may
be?  Am I doing something wrong in this code?

Thanks in advance for any insights.

Hi all!

I am working with Lucene 1.3 RC1 and found what I think is a problem.
Basically, I am indexing into a RAMDirectory and then using addIndexes to
merge the RAMDirectory into a file system index.  Adding in a small
number of documents doesn't seem to work.

My test code is like this:

		Directory memDir = new RAMDirectory();

		File tempDir = new File(System.getProperty("user.dir"), "test2");
		Directory fsDir = FSDirectory.getDirectory(tempDir, true);

		IndexWriter fsWriter =
			new IndexWriter(fsDir, new StandardAnalyzer(), true);

		IndexWriter memWriter =
			new IndexWriter(memDir, new StandardAnalyzer(), true);

		Document toAdd1 = createADocument(); // creates a random document
		Document toAdd2 = createADocument();

		memWriter.addDocument(toAdd1);
		memWriter.addDocument(toAdd2);

	      String[] files = memDir.list();
	      for(int i=0;i<1;i++){
              System.out.println(files[i]); // Only lists "segments" file,
no data files
            }

		fsWriter.addIndexes(new Directory[] { memDir });

		fsWriter.close();

		IndexReader reader =
			IndexReader.open(FSDirectory.getDirectory(tempDir, false));

            Document toCompare = reader.document(1); // Results in
ArrayIndexOutofBoundsException

		reader.close();
		tempDir.delete();

I should be able to get the document at index 1, but it fails.  If I add in
12 documents by doing this:

memWriter.addDocument(toAdd1);
memWriter.addDocument(toAdd2);

for(int i=0;i<10;i++){
	memWriter.addDocument(createADocument());
}

I only see 10 documents returned by IndexReader.termDocs(Term) on the
FSDirectory after I merge the RAMDirectory in.  Any insights on why this may
be?  Am I doing something wrong in this code?

Thanks in advance for any insights.

Joe W.

Yep. What I've done is hack a little class to pool the searchers,=
 and whenever 
I update the index, I inform this manager class, and it refreshes=
 the 
searchers. Of course, you can add sugar on top of that, like=
 specifying a TTL 
or something like that.

Hi,
    I am a newbie on Lucene. Now I want to index all my harddisk contents for searching, these includes html file, pdf file, word file and etc. But I have encounter a problem when I try to index pdf files, I need your help.
    My environment is lucene-1.3-rc (lucene-1.2 has also been tried), jdk1.4.02, pdfbox-0.62. I try to index all my pdfs. There seems no error when executing the indexing (I use StandardAnalyzer, you can refer to my sources in the attachment). But when I search using the keyword, I find a lot of useless results. The pdf haven't contain the content I want. Can you help me with this problem.
    In my attachment, I put my source files and the test pdf files. After I use my program to index these three pdf files, it seems all right then. But when I search the result using keyword "cisco" based on the indexing result, I get three Hits as the result. But two of the results do not contain the keyword "cisco", they are useless. I wonder if the pdfbox wrong, so I print out the indexed content, it also does not contain the keyword "cisco". I use Luke and my searcher program as the searching client, it seems no problem.
    Can anyone help me? Or any comments on this problem. Everyone is welcome. My email is suny@ffcs.fujitsu.co.jp.
    suny 

PS: sorry, I can not attach the files, this mailing list can not hold attachment? So I have to put my source codes here. My three test pdf files are totally 100k, if someone would like to help me test it, I will be very appreciate.

Hello

I'm trying to update a document in my index. As far as i can tell from =
the FAQ and other places of documentation, the only way to do this is by =
deleting the document and adding it again.

Now, I want to be able to add the document a new but keep from having to =
re-parse the original file again. That is i want to extract a document =
from the index (and keep a copy in memory), delete the document from the =
index, update a field in the doc in memory and add the doc to index once =
again.

I imagine that it has to be done something like this :

1. extract the desired document from index with a function returning the =
document (not complete code):

Document doc;
String fileNameToGetFromIdx
String tempName

   for ( int i =3D 0; i < numDocs; i++ )
   {
    if ( !indexreader.isDeleted( i ) )
    {
     doc =3D indexreader.document( i );

     if ( doc !=3D null )
     {
      tmpName =3D ( doc.get( "pathToFileOnDisk" ) );=20

      if ( tmpName.equals( fileNameToGetFromIdx ) )
      {
       ir.delete( i );
       return doc;
      }
     }
    }
   }

This would leave me with the document in memory and the document deleted =
from the index -right?


2. update a field in the document by adding the field again.

 doc.add( Field.Text( "someField", "value" ) );

The API for Document says that if multiple fields exists with the same =
name, the value of the last value added is returned when getting the =
value.


3. add the document to the index again

indexwriter.addDocument( doc );


Is this a correct way of doing an update because i can't seem to get i =
to work properly.
The reason for trying it this way is to not having to reindex the =
original file again. I have many large PDF documents which takes some =
time to index :-(

Bottom line -when i do a search and a list of search results are =
displayed to the user, the user clicks the title of the document and the =
document is shown to the user. Before the document is shown i execute an =
update function to increase the number of times the documents has been =
visited -hence i need to update the visited field of that particular =
document in the index.

Uhm -hope you get the idea :-)

Any suggestions and comments are very welcome

thanks in advance

BTW : does anyone know if an update function is planned to be added to =
lucene? Would it be hard to write it yourself?

When you use luke to look at your index does it show the correct contents
for those documents?

Hi,
    When I use luke to look at my index, it seems all right. The content in the index is well, all the contents are extracted from the pdf file. I copy the pdf file content (namely "content" field), and search the keyword, but I can not found the keyword either. I think there is nothing wrong with the pdfbox program.

    Would you please help me to test this situation. I have three pdf file(totally 100k), after I index them,  I will get useless results when I ues "cisco" as the keyword. If you would like to help me, I will send you my test source files and the three pdf files to you. I will be very appreciate for your help.

Hello Terry,

Lucene can do forward indexing, as Mark Rosen outlines in his Master's
thesis: http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/rosen03email.html.

We use a similar approach for (probabilistic) latent semantic analysis and
vector space searches. However, the solution is not really completely fixed
yet, therefore no code at this time...

Best regards,

Gregor

Hi Terry,

we have been thinking about the same problem and in the end we decided
that most likely the only good solution to this is to keep a
non-inverted index, i.e. a map from the documents to the terms. Then you
can query the most terms for the documents and query other documents
matching parts of this (where you get the usual question of what is
actually interesting: high frequency, low frequency or the mid range).

Indexing would probably be quite expensive since Lucene doesn't seem to
support changes in the index, and the index for the terms would change
all the time. We haven't implemented it yet, but it shouldn't be hard to
code. I just wouldn't expect good performance when indexing large
collections.

Hey there.  What's the fastest way to do a batch index with lucene 1.3-rc1
on a dual or quad-processor box?  The files I'm indexing are very easy to
split divide among multiple threads.

Here's what I've done at this point:

Each thread has its own IndexWriter writing to its own RAMDirectory.  Every
<number> of documents, I mergeIndexes the thread's index to the main disk
index.

The thread writers have a mergeFactor of 50.
The disk indexWriter has a mergeFactor of 30.
I call optimize only on the main disk index, and only once at the very end.

Just doing this has shown great improvements for me, but I want to squeeze
out every bit of performance I can.  What's the fastest way to mergeIndexes?
Should I use a low mergeFactor when working with RAMDirectorys?  Should I
optimize the thread index before I merge it to the main one?

Thanks!

That is an old FAQ item.  Lucene has been thread safe for a while now.

I don't know the details of how lock files are unreliable over NFS, only 
that they are.  The window of vulnerability, when the lock file is used, 
is when one JVM is opening all of the files in an index, and another is 
completing an update at the same time.  If the updating machine removes 
some files after the opening machine has read the 'segments' file but 
before it has opened all of the files, then the open will fail with a 
FileNotFound exception.  If your application can guarantee that indexes 
are not opened while an update is completing (under IndexWriter.close() 
or IndexReader.close() for deletions) then this will not be a problem.

Looks like I spoke too soon... As the index gets larger, time to merge
becomes prohibitably high.  It appears to increase linearly.

Oh well.  I guess I'll just have to go with about 3ms/doc.

As the index grows, disk i/o becomes the bottleneck.  The default 
indexing parameters do a pretty good job of optimizing this.  But if you 
have lots of CPUs and lots of disks, you might try building several 
indexes in parallel, each containing a subset of the documents, optimize 
each index and finally merge them all into a single index at the end. 
But you need lots of i/o capacity for this to pay off.

Isn't it better for Dan to skip the optimization phase before merging? I 
am not sure, but he could save some time on this (if he has enough file 
handles for that, of course). What strategy do you use in "nutch"?

The index should be fine.  Lucene index updates are atomic.

It depends.  If you have 10 machines, each with a single disk, that you 
use for indexing in parallel, and copy all of the indexes to a single 
machine for the final merge, then you're probably better off optimizing 
each index before copying it and merging it with the others, in order to 
maximize the amount of work done in parallel, using all disk spindles. 
However, if instead you have one machine with ten processors and a 
filesystem striped across ten disks, then, in theory, optimizing before 
merging might not help much, since the single-threaded final merge could 
use all ten disks at once.  Even then, though the final merge would be 
doing some CPU work serially which would have been done in parallel in 
the first configuration.  In general I think it's best to do as much 
work as possible in parallel.

 > What strategy do you use in "nutch"?

Nutch builds optimized indexes for each fetched "segment" (n.b., a Nutch 
segment is different than a Lucene segment) and only merges segment 
indexes as the final step before deploying them for searching.  Nutch 
has a rolling set of active segments: the oldest are periodically 
discarded and replaced with newly fetched segments.  Before a new set of 
segments is deployed, duplicate elimination processing must occur, which 
marks duplicates as deleted prior to merging new production indexes.

Hi all,

it seems there are quite a few people looking for similar features, i.e. 
(a) document identity and (b) forward indexing. So far we hacked (a) by 
using a wrapper implementing equals/hashcode based on a unique field, 
but of course that assumes maintaining a unique field in the index. (b) 
is something we haven't tackled yet, but plan to.

The source code for Mark's thesis seems to be part of the Haystack 
distribution. The comments in the files put it under Apche-license. This 
seems to make it a good candidate to be included at least in the Lucene 
sandbox -- although I haven't tried it myself yet. But it sounds like a 
good candidate for us to use.

Since the haystack source is a bit larger and I actually couldn't get 
the download at the moment, here is a copy of the relevant bit grabbed 
from one of my colleague's machines:

  http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/~pbecker/luceneHaystack.tar.gz (22kb)

Note that this is just a tarball of src/org/apache/lucene out of some 
Haystack source. Untested, unmodified.

I'd love to see something like this supported in the Lucene context were 
people might actually find it :-)

  Peter

Hello, 
I'm having some trouble trying to figure out how I can Multi-thread a
search.  I have 10 separate indices (on the same box) and so I have an array
of IndexSearcher's - then I pass the array to a MultiSeacher (see below for
the code).  From what I have read, this does a sequential search through all
of the indices.  What I'm hoping to do, is have a thread for each
IndexSearcher and have them all search concurrently.  

Couple of questions - 1) Does anyone have any sample code that will achieve
this?
			    2) How will Lucene handle the results with
multiple threads? For example, if I have 10 threads and
threads 2 and 3 have finished, but the rest are still searching.

thanks, 
Tom

Why do you have concurency problems? are you trying to
have each user initiate the indexing himself? because
that will create issues, how about you put all the new
files you want to index in a directory and then have a
schedule procedure on the webserver run the lucene
indexer on that directory, our application hasn't had
any concurrency problems at all, because we index based
on a pull system, rather than the user puching
documents to the indexer.

I hope I understood your problem correctly, so that the
answer is useful

Hi Peter,

I took a look at Mark's thesis and briefly at some of his code.  It appears
to me that what he's done with the so-called forward indexing is to (a)
include a unique id with each document (allowing retrieval by id rather than
by a standard query), and to (b) include a frequency map class with each
document (allowing easier retrieval of term frequency information).

Now I may be missing something very obvious, but it seems to me that both of
these functions can be done rather easily with the standard (unmodified)
version of Lucene.  Moreover, I don't understand how use of these functions
will facilitate retrieval of documents that are "similar" to a selected
document, as outlined in my original question on this topic.

Could you (or anyone else, of course) perhaps elaborate just a bit on how
using this approach will help achieve that end?

Regards,

Terry

Hi Terry,

exactly these two features of (a) having a unique identifier and (b) 
easily finding the term frequencies for the document is what we (i.e. 
our working group and seemingly others) are missing.

(a) As far as I understand Lucene, there is no such notion as value 
identity on Document instances. This is a problem if you want to do 
things like applying set-theory as we did. The workaround is easy: store 
a unique id in the index and wrap the documents in an object using this 
field as base for equals/hashCode. But it still has to be done, you need 
the unique id in the index and it is not really elegant since you have 
to go through the wrapper all the time.

(b) Lucene allows you to find term frequencies in the index, but not for 
subsets or single items. Many information retrieval approaches define 
document similarity using metrics on the term frequencies. The more 
similar the term frequencies, the more similar the documents are 
considered. You get different details and levels of complexity (esp. if 
you try to mix in background knowledge like knowing synonyms and 
generalizations of the terms), but the basic idea is that documents are 
similar if they contain the same terms (and maybe even in the same 
amounts). I failed to find a way to get Lucene to give me this 
information without hacking this or that. Considering the attention IR 
techniques like latent semantic analysis (LSA) and others get nowadays 
(and rightfully so I think), not finding these features in Lucene was a 
bit of a surprise. I still haven't looked at Mark's code, but I would be 
surprised if he had to do much. But you still have to do something.

After the more abstract talk a bit of a more concrete answer for your 
question: one simple way of defining similarity of documents is just 
treating the term frequencies of some (or all) terms as a vector space 
and then use a metric in the vector space to define distance. If you 
have two frequency maps, you can for example go through all keys in 
them, create all differences of the values attached (assuming null if a 
term is not in a map) and sum them up (giving you the manhattan metric 
in R^n), then you divide by the numbers of terms to normalize (the 
frequency maps are probably of different lengths) and that might give 
you a reasonable first try. If the result is zero, you consider the 
documents to be extremely similar, the higher the value, the more 
different they are suppossed to be.

The approach I described is a bit too naive to be really good -- for 
example I'd expect some bias towards more similarity on documents with 
less terms. And there are so many other enhancements you could do. 
Actually the whole idea is a field of research. And one I am not really 
expert in, I just sometimes work with people who are. This might help:

  
http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/cs?q=latent+semantic+analysis&submit=Search+Documents&cs=1

Maybe someone else on the list has better pointers.

  Peter

Bring up one machine as a master Index.  All index updates should be 
performed here.  You can then take machines out of service, rsync the 
index, then bring them back online.

Also the IndexSearcher can work with multiple indexes and you can just 
keep syncing mulitple indexes over instead of updating one monolothic 
index.  In this situation you wouldn't need to take machines offline but 
you would have to swap in the new index once the rsync is complete.  A 
simple dir rename could make this atomic.

Apologies for asking the obvious, but could someone explain why
Documents.Document is a sealed class?

Seems like many of us would love to implement UniqueDocument to support
this oft-requested uniqueness field.  Would still have the task of
implementing an IndexWriterEx.AddDocument(UniqueDocument), but all the
"uniqueness" tests could be encapsulated in UniqueDocument...

Along the same lines, Document.Field is also sealed... Have others
wished to derive from that, too?  In our case, it would be to have a
notion of field "schemas" so the isstored, isindexed, istokenized
values, etc. could be defined once for the field.  More exotic things
like field aliases, etc. could be implemented there, too.

Just curious... Wrapping the classes works fine for now.

Has anyone experimented with using EJB's for carrying out searches? I'm =
thinking of using an EJB for carrying out the searches and return the =
hits to a JSP page, which handles displaying of the results.=20
But Hits isn't serializable, so it cannot be used for sending across the =
network from for example JBoss to Tomcat.

Does anyone has any experience with using Lucene through EJB's ....

You'll want to checkout Andy Scholz's excellent 
http://ejindex.sourceforge.net/. It's an EJB implementation of a=
 layer built on 
top of Lucene to allow for distributed searching.

The Hits collection needs to get back to the index itself to retrieve 
Documents.  My strategy has been to collection all the Documents from 
Hits as a List of Maps, and hand that back across a session bean 
boundary.

I will look at ejindex in detail in the near future to see how it works.

Excuse me if this is off-topic, but isn't hacking the code what open source
software is all about?  I mean, its always better to try to do it with
existing methods but if it can't, why not hack the source?  If it works and
people use it then it should probably be incorporated into the main source
tree.  If poeple don't use it (or the hack is terribly ugly, which may be
what you were referring to) then it doesn't make the cut.  In either case,
I'm just wondering why I see many questions or answers include this almost
standard reply.  I hack the source regularly to acheive a needed goal.
Sure its not forward-compatible, but if I waited for the feature to be added
on its own, our project would never get off the ground.

Not always, but quite often :-)

Because you might need to put quite some effort into getting it right? 
Because you might do something someone else already did better -- which 
is not really against the spirit of hackerism, but I have so many other 
things to hack where I think I can do better than most people. Inverted 
file indexes is not my particular domain.

That needs exposure. If some Lucene code is hidden in the Haystack 
project, it won't get enough exposure IMO.

One of the important things about OSS for me is resuse and 
collaboration. If you hack things again and again without trying to turn 
it into something reusable, I'd say you constantly create small 
proprietary forks based on open source code but you are not part of any 
OSS effort. That's of course my point of view on OSS, but then you asked 
for it :-)

As a user of Lucene I missed some features. Part of the OSS culture is 
for me to tell others about this and maybe to try to find solutions. 
Mark's code seems to be one, so I proposed to consider adding it into 
some spot with better exposure for testing. And I don't seem to be the 
only person with the need for these features. I think Lucene would be 
better if these features were easily available. If the Lucene team 
doesn't think so -- fair enough, it is their project. But asking me to 
stop requesting features in a (hopefully) sensible way is pretty much 
against the spirit of OSS and hacker culture as far as I understand it.

Does that answer your questions?

  Peter

[Note: I sent this email before I recieved my subscription confirmation 
message and I have not seen it in the archives yet. If you recieved this 
message twice, my appologies. -- Luke]

According to the jGuru FAQ, QueryParser is not thread safe:

http://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=492389

However, this information is several years old. Is this still true?

The answer to the question suggests using a new parser for every thread,
but the QueryParser.parse(String query,String field,Analyzer analyzer) 
method is static, and I don't see any way to set the default field on an
instance of the QueryParser.

Is that what the "f" parameter of the QueryParser(String f, Analyzer a)
constrcutor is for?

Thanks for your advice,

Luke Francl

Hi all...

I've been playing with Lucene for a couple days now and I have a couple 
questions I'm hoping some one can help me with.  I've created a Lucene 
index with data from a database that's in several different fields, and 
I want to set up a web page where users can search the index.  Ideally, 
all searches should be as google-like as possible.  In Lucene terms, I 
guess this means the query should be fuzzy.  For example, if someone 
searches for "cancer" then I'd like to get back all resuls with any form 
of the word cancer in the term ("cancerous", "breast cancer", etc.).

So far, I seem to be having two problems:

1) How can I search all fields at the same time?  The QueryParser seems 
to only search one specific field.

2) How can I automatically default all searches into fuzzy mode?  I 
don't want my users to have to know that they must add a "~" at the end 
of all their terms.

Thanks,
-Mark

The common thing I've done and seen others do is glue all the fields 
together into a master searchable field named something like "contents" 
or "keywords" (be sure to put a space in between text so it can be 
tokenized properly).

Your description of searches for "cancer" finding "cancerous" isn't 
really what the fuzzy query is about.  What you're after, I think, is 
more the stemming algorithms used during the analysis phase.  Have a 
look at the SnowballAnalyzer in the Lucene sandbox.  There is a little 
bit about it in the article I wrote for java.net: 
http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2003/07/30/LuceneIntro.html - it 
definitely sounds like more work in the analysis phase is what you're 
after.

Hi Mark,

short answers to your questions:

ad 1: MultiFieldQueryParser is what you might want: you can specify the
fields to run the query on. Alternatively, the practice of duplicating the
contents of all separate fields in question into one additional merged field
has been suggested, which enables you to use QueryParser itself.

ad 2: Depending on the Analyzer you use, the query is normalised, i.e.,
stemmed (remove suffices from words) and stopword-filtered (remove highly
frequent words). Have a look at StandardAnalyzer.tokenStream(...) to see how
the different filters work. In the analysis package the 1.3rc2 Lucene
distribution has a Porter stemming algorithm: PorterStemmer.

Have fun,

Gregor

1. You need to use MultiFieldQueryParser
2. I think you should use PorterStemFilter instead of fuzzy query

Hi Terry,

the suggestion of Haystack's Lucene was a hint to give you an additional
alternative to reach your goal.

Depending on the definition of your notion "similar document", this solution
does or does not make sense. My definition of similar document (and term) is
maybe more general than yours: It supports rather generic similarity metrics
and needs to cover cosine similarity according to vector-space model (VSM;
can be achieved using unmodified Lucene code), semantic similarity according
to a generative model like latent semantic indexing or Bayesian approaches
etc. and even semantic similarity according to a taxonomy. If you want such
a flexibility (like I do for my research), you should consider this approach
because you can relatively easily work on the forward document vectors.

If all you need is vanilla VSM cosine similarity, you are probably best off
with the suggestion that was sent in this list, to submit the document
content in the query and throw it through the same Analyzer that was used to
create the index, thus finding best matches using Lucene's standard matching
scheme.

Good luck,

Gregor

Hi Peter,

I took a look at Mark's thesis and briefly at some of his code.  It appears
to me that what he's done with the so-called forward indexing is to (a)
include a unique id with each document (allowing retrieval by id rather than
by a standard query), and to (b) include a frequency map class with each
document (allowing easier retrieval of term frequency information).

Now I may be missing something very obvious, but it seems to me that both of
these functions can be done rather easily with the standard (unmodified)
version of Lucene.  Moreover, I don't understand how use of these functions
will facilitate retrieval of documents that are "similar" to a selected
document, as outlined in my original question on this topic.

Could you (or anyone else, of course) perhaps elaborate just a bit on how
using this approach will help achieve that end?

Regards,

Terry

This method constructs a new query parser each time it is called, so it

Yes.

Ah, I've been testing out something similar to the latter.  I've been 
adding multiple values on the same key.  Won't this have the same 
effect?  I've been assuming that if I do

doc.add(Field.Keyword("content", "value1");
doc.add(Field.Keyword("content", "value2");

And did a search on the "content" field for either value, I'd get a hit, 
and it seems to work.  This way, I figure I'd be able to differentiate 
between values that I want tokenized and values that I don't.

Is there a difference between this and building a StringBuffer 
containing all the values and storing that as a single field-value?

Hi Mark.

Sorry, it's rc1 really which is out. But if you go to the cvs server, then
you'll find the rc2-dev version.

Multiple calls to Document.add with the same field results in that "their
text is treated as though appended for the purposes of search." (API doc).

Can you try out if there's a differece between the cases you mention? I don'
t know but I'd be interested as well;-).

Gregor

Hello,

This is more a sanity check, than anything else, but...

I'm trying to delete a document using IndexReader.delete(Term)... (for 
the record I'm using 1.3-rc1)

The document was created with a Field.Keyword() to uniquely identify it.

The document exists, was saved, can be queried, life is good :)

But then... when trying to delete the same document later on... 
IndexReader.delete(Term) returns 0 and the document doesn't get 
deleted... which is driving me crazy 8}

Here is what I'm doing to delete the document:

     Term	aTerm = new Term( aKey, anID );

     aReader.delete( aTerm );
     aReader.close();

The term looks like the following:

szid:3FA7168800F7FDE8ECAA35500A00012D

But this doesn't seem to do anything... The document is still there no 
matter what...

I'm sure I'm doing something very wrong, but for the life of me I 
cannot see what... anything obvious I'm missing?

Thanks.

Cheers,

PA.

There is a big difference between using Field.Text and Field.Keyword, 
yes.  It all depends on how you want things tokenized (or not).  
Field.Keyword does not tokenize (via the Analyzer), but Field.Text does.

What you are doing looks fine to me.  I'm sure these are obvious 
questions, kinda like "is your computer plugged in?", but here goes:

- How are you determining that the document is still there?  With an 
IndexReader?  IndexSearcher?
- A freshly created (i.e. after the delete) Index[Searcher|Reader]?
- And finally, did you remember to recompile?!  :))  (just kidding)

Thanks for the moral support :)

In any case, hard liquors and coding doesn't always mix well together, 
so obviously I was shooting myself in the foot...

For the record, I'm using a RAMDirectory which then gets flushed into a 
FSDirectory.

Deleting something means checking both the RAM and FS directory. Which 
is what I do.

But... because of the internal caching done by the IndexWriter, a 
document is not made available straight away... therefore 
IndexReader.delete(Term) returning zero and me banging my head against 
the wall... adjusting the order of operations did solve the "problem"...

Which brings a question: is there a way to influence the IndexWriter's 
internal RAM cache, beside closing or optimizing a writer?

Cheers,

PA.

Yep.  I guess we have different philosophies but are more or less heading toward the same goal :)   I've been on other projects
where the response to questions has been "look at the source".  So maybe I have gotten into a bad habit of hacking first and asking
questions second.  thanks for the excellent reply, btw.

Hi,

I am getting exceptions because Lucene can't rename files.  Here are a
couple of the exceptions that I'm getting:
 - java.io.IOException: couldn't rename _6lr.tmp to _6lr.del
 - java.io.IOException: couldn't rename segments.new to segments

I am able to index many documents successfully on my Windows machine.
The problem occurs for me during the updating process.  My updating
process goes like this:

  for (each xml file i want to index) {
    // create new document
    parse the xml file
    populate a new Lucene document with the fields from my XML file

    // remove old document from index
    open an index reader
    delete the term from the index   // this successfully deletes the
one document
    close the index reader

    // add new document to index
    open an index writer
    add the document to the index writer
    close the index writer
  }
  =20
Any ideas on how to stop these exceptions from occuring?  No other
process is reading or writing to the index while this process is
running.

Thanks,
Reece

Hi,

it is very easy to provoke the errrors you describe
when you are opening many alternating writers and=20
readers on Windows.

You can circumvent this problem by using fewer
writer and reader objects, e.g., first delete
all documents to update, then write all the
updated documents. Or use a second index
only for the writing and merge this into the first
after you have deleted the update documents
there.

Regards,

Karsten

I just switched to RC2 and found that a number of queries now don't =
work.  (When I switch back to RC! they work fine.)  Can't seem to figure =
out a pattern regarding those that don't work versus those (the vast =
majority) that still work fine.  I looked in the RC2 source and noticed =
that the dates on IndexWriter and IndexReader and a bunch of related =
modules seem to have been changed.

Is it necessary to reindex (a major task for my stuff) to use RC2?

Regards,

Terry

Hi,

I am getting exceptions because Lucene can't rename files.  Here are a
couple of the exceptions that I'm getting:
 - java.io.IOException: couldn't rename _6lr.tmp to _6lr.del
 - java.io.IOException: couldn't rename segments.new to segments

I am able to index many documents successfully on my Windows machine.
The problem occurs for me during the updating process.  My updating
process goes like this:

  for (each xml file i want to index) {
    // create new document
    parse the xml file
    populate a new Lucene document with the fields from my XML file

    // remove old document from index
    open an index reader
    delete the term from the index   // this successfully deletes the
one document
    close the index reader

    // add new document to index
    open an index writer
    add the document to the index writer
    close the index writer
  }
  =20
Any ideas on how to stop these exceptions from occuring?  No other
process is reading or writing to the index while this process is
running.

Thanks,
Reece

I've created and index that has a Keyword field in it.  I'm trying to do a 
search on that field where my term has a space and the wildcard character in 
it.  For example, I'll issue the following search:  project_name:"Hello w*". 
  I have an entry in the project_name field of "Hello world".  I would 
expect to get a hit on this but I don't.  Is this not the way Lucene 
behaves? Am I doing something wrong?  Thanks.

Brian,

This seems akin to the Phrase Searching problem that I encountered (haven't
heard anything back from my posting yet) - which goes as follows:  I try to
do the phrase search "center* form" but the system seems to simply ignore
the wildcard (throws it away) when processing the search - so I get only
results for "center form".  My guess is the parser is processing your search
simply as if it were "hello w".

I've got no solution - was hoping to hear something from the list.

Joe

If I understand your issue correctly, I think what you're experiencing is
the fact that you can have a phrase query "hello world", or a wildcard query
+hell* +wor*, but you can't mix the two together.  As far as I've found,
that's a basic limitation you just have to live with.  (Of course, if
someone on the list can show me where I'm wrong, I'll be delighted.)  You
can add boosting to any kind of term (such as wor*^10 or "world order"^10),
but (I don't think) you can't mix wildcards and phrases.

HTH,

Terry

Basically, yes, I am trying to put a wildcard in a phrase.  My field (a 
Keyword) is the name of a project.  It can be 40 characters long (I'm 
basically indexing some database columns).  Since it is a Keyword and not a 
Text field, it doesn't get tokenized (I do this on purpose) and must match 
up exactly.  I would like for users to be able to search on partial phrases 
such as "Hello w*" and match up to "Hello world" and "Hello washington", 
etc.  Is this not possible?  Is it documented anywhere?

Thanks.
-Brian

Ok, on the first posting about RC2 i looked for et, but as I did not find
any RC2 I guessed he was mistaken... but now? What RC2 are You talking about
and if its 1.3RC2 where do I find it and why does the webpage not mention it
(or the download area hold it) ?

I agree.  When I said I was using RC2, that wasn't quite accurate.  I was
using the latest CVS offering, which could have other changes beyond RC2.  A
convenient way to get RC2 would be beneficial.

Terry

This can be done, AFAIK.

This is one thing that many people seem unaware of: you don't HAVE to use
QueryParser to build queries. In your case it seems like you should be able
to construct query you want if you either by-pass QueryParser, or create
a dummy analyzer (one that does no tokenization but returns all input as
one token).

Since QueryParser is fairly simple class, you should be able to see how wild 
card queries are constructed. You can not (and need not) create a phrase 
query since it does not allow wild cards (like someone pointed out), but 
since the whole phrase is just one token for keyword fields, you can use 
normal wild card query (or prefix for cases like "Hello w*").

It would be nice if FAQ could point out that QueryParser is higher-level 
interface to query part, but it is possible and sometimes necessary to do 
your own query construction. I think it's very cool Lucene queries were 
properly modularized this way -- too many open source projects have 
components too tightly coupled.

Tatu,

I agree.  One problem, however, that new (and not-so-new) Lucene users face
is a learning curve when they want to get past the simplest and most obvious
uses of Lucene.  For example, I don't think any of the docs mention the fact
that you can't combine a phrase and a wildcard query.  Other things that are
obviously quite well understood by many members of the list, are still
less-than-clear to others.  For example, I found (and still find) it a bit
difficult to find concrete examples/advice of how to get good benefit from
filters.

My whole point is that this is a *very* powerful and flexible technology.
But I think it's often very difficult for those most experienced in using
Lucene to fully appreciate how it looks from the "newbie" point of view.

Just my $0.02.

Regards,

Terry

I agree completely. Perhaps I worded my reply badly; I didn't mean to sound 
hostile towards new users at all -- after all I consider myself to be one (I 
just happened to work on simple improvements to QueryParser and learnt how it 
works). I wish documentation was more complete; perhaps some section could 
list common workarounds or insights. And perhaps incompatibility of phrase 
and wild card queries could be added to document that lists current 
limitations.

I guess the reason I think it's valuable to document the flexibility of query 
construction is that I have been working on something similar (although 
working with database queries) in a system I'm working on, and I have also 
seen systems that have query syntax that's too intertwined with backend 
implementation (for example, while Hibernate is a good ORM, its queries don't 
seem to have backend independent intermediate representation... which makes 
it hard to develop different kinds of backends). So, it's useful to know that 
there are 2 levels of interfaces to Lucene's query functionality.

Tatu,

My comments were not intended to be directed specifically toward you.  And I
don't think you worded your reply badly.

<soapbox>
Rather, it is my general observation, after participating in this list for a
year and a half, that there seems to be a consistently big gap between
Lucene newbies and "old hands".    Bridging that gap isn't simply a matter
of RTFM, because the available "manual" just scratches the surface of what
can be done.  It is my experience that you have to become immersed in the
details quite a bit before important aspects become evident.  Some will say
that's OK, because everyone is expected to "do their own homework."  I would
agree, if there was sufficient material available to study.  But simply
because Lucene is so powerful and capable and (IMHO) cutting edge, people
could use a bit more help not only in getting started, but in tapping some
of its more refined capabilities.
</soapbox>

Regards,

Terry

PS: If there is general interest in doing some documentation enhancement,
I'd be happy to participate/contribute.
